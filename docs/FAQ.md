# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is HTTP Over Ham Radio?

HTTP Over Ham Radio is a Progressive Web Application that enables web content transmission over amateur radio frequencies using digital modes. It combines modern web technologies with ham radio to create a decentralized, offline-capable communication network.

### Do I need a ham radio license?

Yes, you need a valid amateur radio license to transmit. However, you can receive and decode signals without a license (SWL - Shortwave Listening).

### What equipment do I need?

**Minimum:**
- Computer with modern web browser
- Amateur radio transceiver
- Audio interface (can be as simple as cables)

**Recommended:**
- Radio with CAT control
- USB audio interface
- Good antenna system

### Which browsers are supported?

- ‚úÖ Chrome 90+ (Full support)
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+ (Full support)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox 88+ (No Web Serial API)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safari 14+ (Limited PWA support)

### Is this legal?

Yes, when used according to amateur radio regulations:
- No encryption of content (signatures are allowed)
- Station identification every 10 minutes
- Non-commercial use only
- Follow your country's band plans

## Technical Questions

### How fast can it transmit data?

Data rates depend on conditions:
- **QPSK-750**: 750 bps (poor conditions)
- **QPSK-1500**: 1500 bps (average)
- **QPSK-2800**: 2800 bps (good conditions)
- **Future**: 16-QAM modes up to 8400 bps

### How much compression is achieved?

Typical compression ratios:
- **Text**: 10-20x reduction
- **HTML**: 15-25x with JSX compilation
- **Images**: 5-10x with optimization
- **Average**: 15x reduction

### What's the maximum range?

Range depends on:
- **Frequency**: HF can go worldwide, VHF/UHF is line-of-sight
- **Power**: Higher power = greater range
- **Propagation**: Varies with solar conditions
- **Mode**: Lower data rates work at greater distances

### Can it work offline?

Yes! The PWA works completely offline:
- Install as PWA for offline access
- All features work without internet
- Data stored locally in IndexedDB
- Sync when connection available

### How does mesh networking work?

The app uses AODV routing:
- Automatic route discovery
- Multi-hop communication
- Self-healing network
- No central coordinator needed

## Setup Questions

### Why can't I connect to my radio?

Common issues:
1. **Wrong COM port**: Check device manager
2. **Baud rate mismatch**: Verify radio settings
3. **Drivers not installed**: Install manufacturer drivers
4. **Browser doesn't support Web Serial**: Use Chrome/Edge

### How do I set audio levels?

1. Start with low levels (20-30%)
2. Transmit test signal
3. Check ALC meter (should barely move)
4. Adjust for -6dB peaks on receive
5. Avoid clipping/distortion

### Which frequency should I use?

Recommended frequencies:
- **20m**: 14.085 MHz (USB)
- **40m**: 7.080 MHz (LSB)
- **2m**: 144.620 MHz (USB)

Always check if frequency is in use first!

### My radio isn't listed as supported

The app supports any radio with:
- CAT control (most modern radios)
- SSB capability
- Audio interface

Generic CAT commands work with most radios.

## Usage Questions

### How do I send my first message?

1. Create content in editor
2. Select data rate (start with QPSK-1500)
3. Click "Transmit"
4. Wait for acknowledgment

### What's the difference between modes?

- **QPSK-750**: Most robust, longest range, slowest
- **QPSK-1500**: Balanced performance
- **QPSK-2800**: Fast but needs good signals

### How do I join a mesh network?

1. Settings ‚Üí Mesh Network
2. Enable mesh mode
3. Enter network name
4. Nodes auto-discover

### Can I transfer files?

Yes, through multiple methods:
- Embed in pages (auto-compressed)
- WebRTC P2P transfer (local network)
- Chunked transfer over radio

### How do I backup my data?

1. Settings ‚Üí Backup
2. Select data to export
3. Save backup file
4. Store securely

## Troubleshooting

### Poor decode rate

Try these solutions:
1. Reduce data rate
2. Adjust audio levels
3. Improve antenna
4. Check for RFI
5. Enable FEC

### High CPU usage

Reduce load:
1. Disable waterfall display
2. Close unused tabs
3. Reduce FFT size
4. Use hardware acceleration

### Messages not getting through

Check:
1. Both stations on same frequency
2. Matching data modes
3. Good signal strength
4. Correct network settings

### Radio keeps keying up

Possible causes:
1. VOX too sensitive
2. Audio feedback
3. RFI into computer
4. Software bug (report it!)

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data encrypted?

- **Over radio**: No encryption (illegal)
- **Local storage**: Encrypted with Web Crypto
- **P2P transfers**: Optional encryption
- **Signatures**: Always used for authentication

### Who can see my transmissions?
