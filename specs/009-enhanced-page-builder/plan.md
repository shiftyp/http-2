   ✅ Structure Decision: Single project (existing codebase)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ✅ No violations - feature enhances existing structure
   ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✅ No unknowns to research - spec fully defined
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Enhanced page builder enabling hierarchical component nesting with unlimited depth. Users can create containers (Form, Table, List, Container) and nest child components within them. Features include a Children tab in property editor for management, visual rendering of nested structures, and deletion warnings for components with children. Implementation builds on existing React/TypeScript page builder architecture.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with ES2022 modules
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, @dnd-kit/core, IndexedDB, Vite
**Storage**: IndexedDB for page persistence, localStorage for user preferences
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, existing test infrastructure
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers supporting PWA, Web Serial API, IndexedDB
**Project Type**: web (frontend PWA)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms UI response, 2.8 kHz bandwidth optimization
**Constraints**: FCC Part 97 compliance, 2KB page size target, offline-first
**Scale/Scope**: Amateur radio operators creating optimized web pages

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (existing PWA project) ✅

- Avoiding patterns? Yes (no wrapper classes, direct component composition) ✅

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes (visual-builder lib exists) ✅
- Libraries listed: jsx-radio (rendering), compression (optimization), database (persistence)
- CLI per library: N/A (browser-based PWA)
- Library docs: Following existing documentation patterns ✅

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (existing TDD workflow) ✅
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes (70% coverage maintained) ✅
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes ✅
- Real dependencies used? Yes (IndexedDB, real DOM) ✅
- Integration tests for: Component nesting, property editing, deletion workflow ✅
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test ✅

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (console logging with categories) ✅
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (no backend in PWA) ✅
- Error context sufficient? Yes (error boundaries, validation) ✅

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Following existing spec versioning (009) ✅
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes (git-based) ✅
- Breaking changes handled? No breaking changes (additive enhancement) ✅

**Structure Decision**: Single project (existing PWA codebase)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   ✅ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain - all resolved during specification
   ✅ All dependencies known and already in use
   ✅ All integration patterns established

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ✅ No research needed - enhancing existing well-understood codebase
   ✅ React component composition patterns: Already implemented
   ✅ IndexedDB persistence: Already implemented

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Decision: Extend existing PageComponent interface with children array
   - Rationale: Minimal disruption to existing architecture
   - Alternatives considered: Separate child management system (rejected for complexity)

**Output**: research.md with architectural decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - PageComponent: Enhanced with children array
   - ComponentChildren: Collection management patterns
   - ComponentHierarchy: Tree traversal algorithms

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - PropertyEditor: onAddChild, onRemoveChild, onSelectChild methods
   - GridCanvas: renderChildComponent, nested component handling
   - PageBuilder: updateComponent with children preservation

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Child component addition/removal
   - Nested component rendering
   - Property editor tab functionality
   - Deletion warning system

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Container creation and child addition workflow
   - Child component property editing
   - Parent-child relationship preservation during operations

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add enhanced page builder context
   - Document new component nesting capabilities
   - Update project status to include nesting features

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from enhanced PropertyEditor contract
- Generate tasks from GridCanvas rendering updates
- Generate tasks from PageBuilder component management
- Each user story → integration test task

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests for children support before implementation
- Dependency order: Interface updates before UI updates before integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution: PropertyEditor and GridCanvas updates

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - feature is additive enhancement*

No violations requiring justification.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [x] Phase 4: Implementation complete (completed during planning)
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
