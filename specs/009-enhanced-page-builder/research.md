# Research: Enhanced Page Builder

## Overview
Research phase for implementing hierarchical component nesting in the existing page builder. All technical unknowns were resolved during specification creation, confirming feasibility within existing architecture.

## Technical Decisions

### Component Hierarchy Architecture
**Decision**: Extend existing PageComponent interface with optional children array
**Rationale**:
- Minimal disruption to existing codebase
- Leverages established React component patterns
- Maintains compatibility with current serialization/compression
- Enables unlimited nesting depth as specified

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate child management system: Rejected for added complexity
- Flat component references: Rejected for poor hierarchy representation
- Database-level relationships: Rejected for PWA offline-first constraints

### Property Editor Enhancement
**Decision**: Add "Children" tab to existing PropertyEditor component
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing tab-based interface
- Clear separation of concerns (basic/advanced/position/children)
- Visual child count indicators provide immediate feedback
- Maintains existing workflow patterns

**Implementation approach**:
- Dropdown for adding child components
- List view for existing children management
- Edit/delete buttons for individual child operations
- Child selection switches PropertyEditor context

### Rendering Strategy
**Decision**: Enhance GridCanvas renderComponentContent for nested children
**Rationale**:
- Container components (Form, Table, List, Container) naturally support children
- Different layout patterns for different container types
- Child components render as nested DOM elements
- Maintains grid-based positioning for parent components

**Container-specific patterns**:
- Form: Sequential child elements with form semantics
- List: Bulleted list items
- Table: Row-based child layout
- Container: Free-form child arrangement

### Persistence and Serialization
**Decision**: Children array serializes naturally with existing PageComponent structure
**Rationale**:
- IndexedDB already handles nested object structures
- JSX-radio compiler can optimize nested templates
- Compression library can identify repeated child patterns
- No additional storage schema changes required

## Performance Considerations

### Bandwidth Optimization
- Nested components increase payload size
- JSX-radio template compilation more critical for child components
- Dictionary compression benefits from common child patterns
- Delta updates preserve efficiency for child-only modifications

### Rendering Performance
- Recursive child rendering requires optimization
- React keys prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Child selection isolation prevents full tree updates
- Memoization opportunities for static child content

### User Experience
- Visual hierarchy indicators prevent confusion
- Deletion warnings prevent accidental data loss
- Child count badges provide immediate feedback
- Edit context switching maintains workflow clarity

## Constitution Compliance

### Amateur Radio Constraints
- Children increase content complexity but not regulatory burden
- FCC Part 97 compliance maintained (no encryption, just hierarchy)
- 2.8 kHz bandwidth limit requires efficient child serialization
- Automatic identification requirements unchanged

### Progressive Web App Architecture
- No backend dependencies introduced
- IndexedDB handles nested structures natively
- Service Worker caching includes child components
- Offline functionality preserved with nested content

### Test-First Development
- Existing TDD workflow applies to child features
- Contract tests for PropertyEditor child methods
- Integration tests for nesting workflows
- Unit tests for child rendering logic

## Implementation Readiness

### Existing Infrastructure Compatibility
✅ PageComponent interface supports extension
✅ PropertyEditor tab architecture scales
✅ GridCanvas rendering extensible
✅ IndexedDB persistence handles nesting
✅ Test infrastructure ready for child features

### New Dependencies
❌ No new external dependencies required
✅ All functionality builds on existing React/@dnd-kit foundation

### Risk Assessment
**Low Risk**: Additive feature with no breaking changes
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage for nested operations
**Rollback**: Children array optional, backward compatible

## Conclusion
Enhanced page builder with component nesting is fully feasible within existing architecture. All technical requirements can be met through incremental enhancements to PropertyEditor, GridCanvas, and PageBuilder components. No constitutional violations or architectural changes required.
