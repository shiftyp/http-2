# Feature Specification: Enhanced Page Builder

**Feature Branch**: `009-enhanced-page-builder`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "enhanced page builder"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Enhanced page builder: component nesting, properties editing, children management
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: content creators, designers
   � Actions: create nested components, edit properties, manage children
   � Data: component hierarchy, properties, relationships
   � Constraints: maintain drag-drop, preserve existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific nesting depth limits?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: property validation rules?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary: create container with nested components
   � Secondary: edit component properties including children
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Component nesting, property editing, children management
6. Identify Key Entities
   � PageComponent, ComponentProperty, ComponentChildren
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Focus on user value, avoid implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators need to build complex page layouts by nesting components within containers, similar to modern web development frameworks. They should be able to create a form container and add input fields, buttons, and text elements as children, then easily edit properties of both parent and child components through an intuitive interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a page builder with component palette, **When** user drags a container onto the canvas, **Then** an empty container appears ready to accept child components
2. **Given** a container component on canvas, **When** user drags a button component onto the container, **Then** the button becomes a child of the container and appears nested inside
3. **Given** a selected component with children, **When** user opens property editor, **Then** a children tab displays all nested components with management options
4. **Given** a child component selected, **When** user edits its properties, **Then** changes apply to the child without affecting parent or siblings
5. **Given** nested components in a container, **When** user drags the container, **Then** all children move together as a unit

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to nest a component inside itself (circular reference)?
- How does system handle deeply nested components (performance)?
- What occurs when deleting a parent component with children?
- How are component relationships maintained during copy/paste operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow components to contain child components in a hierarchical structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a "Children" tab in the property editor when a component is selected
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to add, remove, and reorder child components within containers
- **FR-004**: System MUST render nested components visually within their parent containers
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain parent-child relationships during drag and drop operations
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to edit properties of individual child components
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent circular component nesting (component cannot contain itself)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support unlimited levels of component hierarchy nesting
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all child components when parent is moved or resized
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to select and edit child components independently of their parents
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual indicators showing parent-child relationships
- **FR-012**: System MUST delete all child components when their parent component is deleted
- **FR-013**: System MUST warn users before deleting components that contain children, showing the count of nested components that will be removed

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PageComponent**: Represents a UI element that can contain properties, style, and an optional array of child components
- **ComponentChildren**: Collection of nested PageComponents within a parent, maintaining order and hierarchy
- **ComponentProperty**: Editable attributes of components including content, styling, and behavior settings
- **ComponentHierarchy**: The tree structure representing parent-child relationships between components
