## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator using HTTP over radio, I need a real-time visual representation of the radio frequency spectrum showing signal strength, noise levels, and SNR across time and frequency, so I can identify clear channels, monitor band conditions, detect interference, and optimize my transmission parameters for reliable communication.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the radio is connected and receiving signals, **When** the operator opens the waterfall display, **Then** the system displays a real-time scrolling waterfall showing frequency on the horizontal axis, time on the vertical axis, and signal strength as color intensity.

2. **Given** the waterfall is displaying spectrum data, **When** signals appear on specific frequencies, **Then** the display shows them as bright colored bands with intensity proportional to signal strength.

3. **Given** the operator is viewing the waterfall, **When** they hover over or click on a specific frequency/time point, **Then** the system displays the exact frequency, signal power level in dBm, and calculated SNR for that point.

4. **Given** poor band conditions with high noise, **When** the operator views the waterfall, **Then** the noise floor is clearly visible as a different color/pattern from actual signals, allowing the operator to assess band quality.

5. **Given** the waterfall is running, **When** the operator adjusts frequency range or bandwidth settings, **Then** the display updates immediately to show the new frequency span without losing historical data.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the audio input is disconnected during waterfall operation?
- How does the system handle extremely strong signals that might saturate the display?
- What occurs when system resources are insufficient for real-time processing?
- How does the display adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions?
- What happens when the frequency range spans multiple amateur bands?
- How does the system handle spurious signals and interference?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
