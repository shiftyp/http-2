# Feature Specification: Delete Pages

**Feature Branch**: `018-delete-pages`
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "delete pages"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Extracted: Need ability to delete pages
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: pages (data), delete (action), users (actors)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked clarifications needed for deletion scope and constraints
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow established for page deletion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Created testable requirements for deletion functionality
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Page entity identified with deletion implications
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - multiple clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to delete pages that I no longer need, so that I can manage my content library effectively and remove outdated or incorrect information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has created pages, **When** they select a page and choose to delete it, **Then** the page is removed from their page list after confirmation
2. **Given** a user is viewing a page they created, **When** they click the delete button, **Then** they are prompted to confirm the deletion
3. **Given** a user confirms page deletion, **When** the deletion is processed, **Then** the page is permanently removed and user is redirected to the page list
4. **Given** a user starts to delete a page, **When** they cancel the confirmation dialog, **Then** the page remains unchanged

### Edge Cases
- What happens when trying to delete a page that is currently being transmitted? → Page is marked as deleted, transmission continues but receivers see deletion status
- How does system handle deletion of pages that have active incoming links? → Links remain but point to archived/deleted page
- What happens if deletion fails due to system error? → User receives error message, page remains unchanged
- Can users recover accidentally deleted pages? → Yes, pages are soft deleted and can be restored from archive
- What happens to cached versions of deleted pages on other nodes? → Pages are marked as deleted, nodes can choose to remove from cache

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to delete any page (both own and cached pages)
- **FR-002**: System MUST request confirmation before deleting a page
- **FR-003**: System MUST mark deleted pages as deleted rather than immediately removing them
- **FR-004**: When an owner deletes a page, system MUST propagate deletion status to all clients
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear feedback when deletion succeeds or fails
- **FR-006**: System MUST soft delete pages and maintain them in an archive for recovery
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to restore soft-deleted pages from the archive
- **FR-008**: System MUST mark pages as deleted even when being accessed by other users
- **FR-009**: System MUST mark cached pages as deleted on mesh network nodes
- **FR-010**: Client nodes MUST have the option to remove deleted pages from their cache
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a "Clear Deleted" option to bulk remove all pages marked as deleted from cache

### Key Entities
- **Page**: Content entity that can be created, viewed, and deleted. Has properties including ID, title, creator, creation date, deletion status, and content components. Soft deletion marks the page as deleted and moves it to archive rather than permanent removal.
