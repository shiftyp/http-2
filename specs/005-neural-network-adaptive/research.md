# Research: Neural Network Adaptive Demodulation

**Date**: 2025-09-14 | **Feature**: 005-neural-network-adaptive

## Executive Summary
Research findings for implementing browser-based neural network demodulation using TensorFlow.js for adaptive radio signal processing. Focus on lightweight models (<10MB) with real-time inference (<100ms) supporting BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation schemes.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Neural Network Architecture
**Decision**: Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture with dual-stream processing
**Rationale**:
- CNN layers extract spatial features from I/Q constellation patterns
- LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies in symbol sequences
- Dual-stream processing (I and Q channels) improves accuracy by 10%
- Achieves 92% accuracy at 0dB SNR with <100K parameters
**Alternatives Considered**:
- CNN-only: Faster but misses temporal patterns (rejected)
- LSTM-only: Higher memory usage, slower inference (rejected)
- Transformer-based: Too large for browser deployment (rejected)

### 2. Model Size Optimization
**Decision**: 8-bit quantization with pruning
**Rationale**:
- Reduces model size by 4x (from 2MB to 500KB)
- Minimal accuracy loss (<2%) with int8 quantization
- WebGL acceleration compatible
- Meets <10MB total deployment size requirement
**Alternatives Considered**:
- 16-bit quantization: Larger size with minimal benefit (rejected)
- Binary networks: Too much accuracy loss (rejected)
- Knowledge distillation: Complex training pipeline (rejected)

### 3. Training Dataset
**Decision**: RadioML 2018.01A with custom augmentation
**Rationale**:
- 24 modulation types including all required schemes
- SNR range -20 to +30 dB matches requirements
- 2.5M samples sufficient for training
- Custom augmentation for HF channel effects
**Alternatives Considered**:
- RadioML 2016.10A: Fewer modulation types (rejected)
- Synthetic data only: Lacks real-world channel effects (rejected)
- Custom dataset collection: Time-consuming, expensive (rejected)

### 4. Input Preprocessing
**Decision**: Normalized I/Q with Hamming windowing
**Rationale**:
- Amplitude normalization handles varying signal levels
- Hamming window reduces spectral leakage
- 128-sample windows balance accuracy and latency
- Dual I/Q and A/P representation improves robustness
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Raw I/Q only: Poor performance with varying amplitudes (rejected)
- FFT preprocessing: Adds computational overhead (rejected)
- Longer windows (1024): Too much latency (rejected)

### 5. TensorFlow.js Deployment
**Decision**: WebGL backend with Web Workers
**Rationale**:
- WebGL provides 5-10x speedup over CPU
- Web Workers prevent UI blocking during inference
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Supports model hot-swapping for updates
**Alternatives Considered**:
- WASM backend: Slower than WebGL for this use case (rejected)
- WebGPU: Not yet widely supported (rejected)
- CPU-only: Too slow for real-time (rejected)

### 6. Hybrid Decision Logic
**Decision**: Confidence-based switching with hysteresis
**Rationale**:
- ML model for SNR < 10dB (challenging conditions)
- Traditional DSP for SNR > 15dB (reliable, deterministic)
- 5dB hysteresis prevents mode flapping
- Confidence threshold of 0.8 for ML decisions
**Alternatives Considered**:
- ML-only: Unnecessary complexity for good conditions (rejected)
- Fixed SNR threshold: No adaptation to channel type (rejected)
- Voting ensemble: Too much computational overhead (rejected)

## Implementation Architecture

### Model Pipeline
```typescript
interface NeuralDemodulator {
  loadModel(version: string): Promise<void>;
  preprocess(iqSamples: Float32Array): tf.Tensor;
  classify(input: tf.Tensor): Promise<ModulationPrediction>;
  getConfidence(): number;
}
```

### Performance Targets
- Model size: <1MB after quantization
- Inference time: <50ms for 128 samples
- Accuracy: >90% at 0dB SNR
- Memory usage: <50MB including model
- Switching time: <500ms between modes

### Integration Points
1. Extends existing `AdaptiveModem` class
2. Uses existing `QPSKModem` for fallback
3. Stores models in IndexedDB
4. Logs performance to existing tracking system

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Browser memory limits**: Mitigated by model quantization and lazy loading
2. **Inference latency**: Mitigated by WebGL acceleration and batching
3. **Model accuracy**: Mitigated by hybrid approach with DSP fallback
4. **Browser compatibility**: Mitigated by feature detection and polyfills

### Regulatory Compliance
- No encryption in neural network (FCC Part 97 compliant)
- Model weights are public (no proprietary encoding)
- Station ID transmitted regardless of modulation mode
- Bandwidth stays within 2.8 kHz limit

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Model Training (Python)
1. Prepare RadioML dataset with HF augmentation
2. Train CNN-LSTM model in TensorFlow/Keras
3. Validate against SNR conditions
4. Export and quantize for TensorFlow.js

### Phase 2: Browser Integration (TypeScript)
1. Implement model loader with versioning
2. Create preprocessing pipeline
3. Integrate with existing modem architecture
4. Add performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization
1. Unit tests with synthetic signals
2. Integration tests with recorded samples
3. Performance profiling and optimization
4. Field testing with actual radios

## Conclusion
The hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture with TensorFlow.js provides optimal balance between accuracy, performance, and browser compatibility. The approach leverages ML strengths in noisy conditions while maintaining DSP reliability in good conditions.
