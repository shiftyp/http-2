**Feature Branch**: `005-neural-network-adaptive`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "neural network adaptive demodulation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator using HTTP over radio, I need the system to automatically adapt its demodulation approach based on changing signal conditions, so that I can maintain reliable communication despite varying propagation conditions, interference, and signal-to-noise ratios without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a radio signal with good SNR (>10 dB), **When** the system receives modulated data, **Then** it automatically selects and applies the optimal demodulation strategy for maximum throughput
2. **Given** deteriorating signal conditions (SNR drops below threshold), **When** the system detects degraded performance, **Then** it switches to a more robust demodulation approach within 500ms
3. **Given** multiple concurrent transmissions on nearby frequencies, **When** interference is detected, **Then** the system adapts its demodulation to minimize error rates
4. **Given** a transmission using an unknown modulation scheme, **When** the system receives the signal, **Then** it attempts to identify and adapt to the modulation type

### Edge Cases
- What happens when signal conditions change rapidly during transmission?
- How does system handle complete loss of signal mid-demodulation?
- What occurs when multiple demodulation strategies have similar confidence scores?
- How does system behave when receiving corrupted training data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically detect current signal quality metrics (SNR, BER, signal strength)
- **FR-002**: System MUST support demodulation of at least BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation schemes
- **FR-003**: System MUST switch between demodulation strategies without losing data in buffer
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain demodulation performance history for 24 hours
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view current demodulation mode and performance metrics
- **FR-006**: System MUST fall back to a default demodulation mode when adaptive approach fails
- **FR-007**: System MUST learn from successful demodulations to improve future performance
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect FCC Part 97 regulations (no encryption, proper station ID)
- **FR-009**: System MUST operate within 2.8 kHz bandwidth constraint
- **FR-010**: System MUST achieve BER < 10^-3 at minimum required SNR for each modulation type (BPSK: -3dB, QPSK: 3dB, 8-PSK: 8dB, 16-QAM: 12dB, 64-QAM: 18dB)
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to manually override automatic demodulation selection when needed
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide confidence scores for demodulation decisions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Signal Metrics**: Real-time measurements of signal quality including SNR, BER, RSSI, frequency offset
- **Demodulation Strategy**: A specific approach for extracting data from modulated signals, with associated performance characteristics
- **Performance History**: Historical record of demodulation attempts, success rates, and signal conditions
- **Modulation Profile**: Characteristics of a detected modulation scheme including symbol rate, constellation, bandwidth
- **Adaptation Rules**: Conditions and thresholds that trigger demodulation strategy changes
