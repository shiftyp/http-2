## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)

8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Implement neural network-based adaptive demodulation for radio signals that automatically selects optimal demodulation strategies based on signal conditions. The system will use TensorFlow.js for browser-based ML inference, supporting BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation schemes with hybrid DSP/ML decision logic.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / ES2022 modules
**Primary Dependencies**: TensorFlow.js 4.x, Web Audio API, existing QPSKModem class
**Storage**: IndexedDB for model storage, performance history
**Testing**: Vitest with integration tests using mock signals
**Target Platform**: Browser (PWA) - Chrome/Edge/Firefox latest versions
**Project Type**: single (browser-based PWA library)
**Performance Goals**: <5ms inference time, <500ms mode switching
**Constraints**: <10MB model size, 2.8 kHz bandwidth, FCC Part 97 compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Support 5 modulation types, -20dB to +30dB SNR range

- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - PWA library extension

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - TensorFlow.js model architecture for modulation classification
   - Optimal CNN/LSTM architecture for I/Q signal processing
   - Model quantization techniques for <10MB size
   - WebAssembly SIMD acceleration options
   - Training pipeline with RadioML or custom datasets

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research TensorFlow.js model architectures for radio signal classification"
   Task: "Find best practices for I/Q signal preprocessing in neural networks"
   Task: "Research model quantization techniques for browser deployment"
   Task: "Evaluate WebAssembly SIMD for TensorFlow.js acceleration"
   Task: "Research RadioML dataset usage and alternatives"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - SignalMetrics: SNR, BER, RSSI, frequency offset
   - DemodulationStrategy: ML model reference, confidence threshold
   - PerformanceHistory: timestamp, modulation, success rate
   - ModulationProfile: constellation points, symbol rate
   - AdaptationRules: SNR thresholds, switching conditions

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Model loading interface
   - Inference API contract
   - Performance metrics API
   - Decision logic interface
   - Output to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test model loading with mock models
   - Test inference with synthetic I/Q data
   - Test performance tracking
   - Tests must fail initially

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Good SNR automatic selection scenario
   - Deteriorating conditions switching scenario
   - Interference adaptation scenario
   - Unknown modulation identification scenario

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add TensorFlow.js integration notes
   - Add neural network demodulation context
   - Keep under 150 lines

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Model training pipeline tasks (Python environment)
- TensorFlow.js conversion tasks
- Browser integration tasks
- Hybrid decision logic tasks
- Performance monitoring tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Loader → Demodulator → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent modules)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - design follows constitutional principles*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)
