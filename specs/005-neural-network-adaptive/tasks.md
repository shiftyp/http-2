# Tasks: Neural Network Adaptive Demodulation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-neural-network-adaptive/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript, TensorFlow.js, browser PWA structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 6 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: None (browser-based, no API)
   → research.md: Technical decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: 5 test scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, TypeScript config
   → Tests: integration tests for each scenario
   → Core: models, neural network, services
   → Integration: IndexedDB, existing modem
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T036)
6. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) must complete first
- Tests (T005-T013) before implementation (T014-T034)
- Data models (T014-T019) before services (T020-T029)
- Core implementation before integration (T030-T034)
- Everything before polish (T035-T043)
- T030 depends on T024-T026 (core demodulator must exist)
- T032 depends on T022 (inference engine needed for worker)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (RED phase of TDD)
- Commit after each task with descriptive message
- Use existing test infrastructure (Vitest, mock signals)
- Leverage existing AdaptiveModem for DSP fallback
- WebGL acceleration is critical for performance targets
- Model files will be in models/ directory, not src/

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before execution*

- [x] All entities from data-model.md have model tasks
- [x] All test scenarios from quickstart.md have integration tests
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T013 before T014-T034)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task in same phase
- [x] Integration with existing AdaptiveModem specified (T030)
- [x] Performance requirements addressed (T012, T038)

## Execution Time Estimate
- Setup: 30 minutes
- Tests: 2-3 hours (writing comprehensive tests)
- Core Implementation: 4-6 hours
- Integration: 2-3 hours
- Polish: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 10-15 hours for complete implementation
