   → No NEEDS CLARIFICATION - FCC requirements are well-defined
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Aligns perfectly with "Amateur Radio First" principle
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research FCC regulations, callsign databases, content filtering
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No violations - enhances constitutional compliance
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Implement comprehensive FCC Part 97 compliance including automatic station identification, encryption blocking for RF mode, content filtering, and third-party traffic validation. Critical for legal amateur radio operation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / ES2022 modules
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing transmission-mode, crypto, mesh-networking libraries
**Storage**: IndexedDB for compliance logs and station data
**Testing**: Vitest with contract/integration/unit tests
**Target Platform**: Progressive Web App (browser-based)
**Project Type**: single (PWA with offline-first architecture)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms compliance checks, <10ms encryption blocking
**Constraints**: FCC Part 97 regulations, browser environment, real-time requirements
**Scale/Scope**: All transmissions monitored, automatic compliance enforcement

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (PWA architecture)
- Using framework directly? Yes (IndexedDB, Web Crypto API)
- Single data model? Yes (compliance events and station data)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct implementation)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed:
  - `fcc-compliance`: Central compliance manager
  - `station-id-timer`: 10-minute identification timer
  - `encryption-guard`: RF mode encryption blocking
  - `content-filter`: Prohibited content detection
  - `callsign-validator`: Amateur radio callsign verification
- CLI per library: Each library will have test CLI
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? Yes

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (IndexedDB, transmission mode manager)
- Integration tests for: compliance scenarios, transmission modes? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (compliance audit trail)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (PWA architecture)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (detailed violation logging)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes (backwards compatibility maintained)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project - PWA architecture per constitution)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - FCC Part 97 specific regulation details and recent updates
   - Amateur radio callsign database sources and formats
   - Content filtering algorithms for amateur radio context
   - Integration points with existing transmission mode system

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research FCC Part 97 identification requirements in detail"
   Task: "Find amateur radio callsign validation databases and APIs"
   Task: "Research content filtering for amateur radio applications"
   Task: "Analyze integration with existing transmission mode detection"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with technical implementation decisions

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - ComplianceManager: Central coordinator
   - StationIDTimer: 10-minute identification tracking
   - EncryptionGuard: RF mode encryption blocking
   - ContentFilter: Prohibited content detection
   - CallsignValidator: Amateur radio callsign verification
   - ComplianceLog: Audit trail of compliance events

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Station identification protocol
   - Encryption blocking interface
   - Content filtering protocol
   - Callsign validation API

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test station ID timer behavior
   - Test encryption blocking in RF mode
   - Test content filtering and warnings
   - Test callsign validation

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - 14 acceptance scenarios from specification
   - Emergency override testing
   - Mixed-mode network compliance

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Add FCC compliance concepts to CLAUDE.md

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate compliance manager library tasks
- Generate station ID timer tasks
- Generate encryption guard tasks
- Generate content filter tasks
- Generate callsign validator tasks
- Generate compliance dashboard UI tasks
- Generate integration test tasks for all 14 acceptance scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Implementation → Integration
- Dependency order: Core libraries → Compliance manager → UI → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where possible

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Complexity Tracking
