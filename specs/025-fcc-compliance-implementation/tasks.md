# Tasks: FCC Compliance Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/025-fcc-compliance-implementation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.x, IndexedDB, Web Crypto API, existing libraries
   → Libraries: fcc-compliance, station-id-timer, encryption-guard, content-filter, callsign-validator
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 8 entities identified
   → contracts/: 6 API endpoints defined
   → research.md: FCC regulations and technical decisions loaded
   → quickstart.md: 5 demo scenarios plus complete example
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: library structure, IndexedDB setup, FCC database integration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, compliance scenarios
   → Core: compliance manager, station ID timer, encryption guard, content filter, callsign validator
   → Integration: transmission mode hooks, crypto function interception, mesh relay validation
   → Polish: unit tests, performance optimization, compliance dashboard
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T030)
6. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### FCC Compliance Requirements
- **Station ID**: Must be accurate to ±100ms of 10-minute deadline
- **Encryption**: Zero tolerance - all encryption must be blocked in RF mode
- **Content**: Conservative filtering with operator override capability
- **Audit Trail**: Every compliance decision must be logged

### Performance Targets
- Station ID check: <5ms
- Encryption validation: <10ms
- Content filtering: <50ms per message
- Callsign validation: <100ms with cache

### Integration Points
- Hook into existing `transmission-mode` library
- Intercept all `crypto/*` function calls
- Filter content before `mesh-dl-protocol` accepts
- Validate callsigns before mesh relay

### Testing Strategy
- All 14 acceptance scenarios from spec must pass
- Performance tests for real-time requirements
- FCC regulation compliance verification
- Emergency mode behavior validation

## Emergency Considerations
- Emergency mode relaxes content filtering but NOT encryption blocking
- Station identification still required during emergencies
- Special emergency callsign formats (EM*, etc.) must be supported
- All emergency activities logged for post-event analysis
