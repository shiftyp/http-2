## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a licensed amateur radio operator, I want the system to automatically ensure FCC Part 97 compliance during all transmissions, so that I can operate legally without manually tracking regulatory requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Station Identification (§97.119)
1. **Given** radio transmission is active for 9 minutes, **When** 10-minute mark approaches, **Then** system automatically transmits station callsign before timeout
2. **Given** a transmission ends, **When** operator stops transmitting, **Then** system appends callsign to final transmission
3. **Given** CQ beacon mode is active, **When** beacon transmits, **Then** each beacon includes station callsign
4. **Given** mesh routing is active, **When** relaying third-party traffic, **Then** both originating and relaying callsigns are included

#### Encryption Control (§97.113)
5. **Given** system is in RF transmission mode, **When** user attempts to send encrypted content, **Then** system blocks encryption and displays FCC violation warning
6. **Given** station data export is requested, **When** transmission mode is RF, **Then** system automatically switches to WebRTC or blocks transfer
7. **Given** user switches from WebRTC to RF mode, **When** encrypted transfers are active, **Then** system stops transfers and warns user
8. **Given** ECDSA signing is needed, **When** in any transmission mode, **Then** digital signatures are allowed (authentication permitted)

#### Content Restrictions (§97.113)
9. **Given** user attempts to transmit music file, **When** MIME type is audio/*, **Then** system blocks transmission with FCC violation warning
10. **Given** profanity is detected in text, **When** content filter scans message, **Then** system warns user and requires confirmation
11. **Given** commercial content indicators detected, **When** analyzing message, **Then** system warns about business communication restrictions

#### Third-Party Traffic (§97.115)
12. **Given** mesh network receives relay request, **When** source callsign is invalid/unlicensed, **Then** system refuses to relay
13. **Given** valid third-party message received, **When** relaying through mesh, **Then** system logs complete relay chain
14. **Given** international traffic detected, **When** checking destination country, **Then** system verifies third-party agreement exists

### Edge Cases
- What happens during emergency communications? System allows emergency traffic but still identifies station
- How to handle mixed-mode networks? Each station enforces its own compliance based on transmission mode
- What if operator's license expires? System checks license validity before transmission
- How to handle grandfathered equipment? Compliance module can be disabled for receive-only operation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Station Identification Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST transmit operator callsign at least every 10 minutes during active transmission
- **FR-002**: System MUST append callsign to the end of each transmission session
- **FR-003**: System MUST include callsign in every CQ beacon transmission
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify both originating and relaying stations for third-party traffic
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple callsign formats (US: K/W/N/A prefixes, international variations)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow manual ID override for special event callsigns

#### Encryption Control Requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect current transmission mode (RF/WebRTC/Hybrid)
- **FR-008**: System MUST block ALL content encryption when transmission mode is RF
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow ECDSA digital signatures in all modes (authentication permitted)
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent station data export over RF (contains private keys)
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically switch to WebRTC for encrypted transfers or block if unavailable
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear warnings when encryption is blocked
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all encryption violation attempts for audit

#### Content Filtering Requirements
- **FR-014**: System MUST detect and block music files (audio/* MIME types) from RF transmission
- **FR-015**: System MUST scan text for profanity and warn operator
- **FR-016**: System MUST detect commercial/business content indicators
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow emergency communications to override content filters
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain whitelist of allowed content types for RF

#### Third-Party Traffic Requirements
- **FR-019**: System MUST validate callsigns before accepting relay requests
- **FR-020**: System MUST maintain audit log of all relayed messages
- **FR-021**: System MUST check international third-party agreements
- **FR-022**: System MUST include relay path in message headers
- **FR-023**: System MUST limit relay depth to prevent loops

#### Monitoring & Reporting Requirements
- **FR-024**: System MUST log all transmissions with timestamp, frequency, mode, and power
- **FR-025**: System MUST track cumulative transmission time for ID timer
- **FR-026**: System MUST provide compliance dashboard showing current status
- **FR-027**: System MUST support compliance report generation for FCC inspection
- **FR-028**: System MUST alert operator before compliance violations occur

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Station ID must transmit within 100ms of 10-minute deadline
- **PR-002**: Encryption checking must add less than 10ms latency
- **PR-003**: Content filtering must process messages in under 50ms
- **PR-004**: Callsign validation must complete in under 20ms

## Notes

### Critical Compliance Gaps Addressed
1. **Station ID Timer**: Automated 10-minute identification per §97.119
2. **Encryption Blocking**: Runtime enforcement for RF mode per §97.113
3. **Content Filtering**: Prohibited content detection per §97.113
4. **Third-Party Validation**: Callsign verification per §97.115

### 2024 FCC Rule Changes Incorporated
- Symbol rate limits removed (was 300 baud, now unrestricted)
- 2.8 kHz bandwidth limit maintained for HF bands
- OFDM and modern protocols now explicitly permitted

### Emergency Communications
System maintains compliance during emergencies but allows:
- Priority routing for emergency traffic
- Override of content filters (except encryption)
- Extended third-party traffic permissions
- Special emergency callsign formats

### International Considerations
- Compliance rules adapt based on operator's country
- Third-party traffic agreements vary by country pair
- Some countries prohibit third-party traffic entirely

This specification ensures full FCC Part 97 compliance while maintaining system usability for amateur radio operators.
