# Feature Specification: WebRTC Local Data Transfer

**Feature Branch**: `002-a-feature-whereby`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a feature whereby logbooks and other data can be transfered via webrtc over local networks using a qr code or shortcode"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An amateur radio operator wants to transfer their complete station data (including logbooks, messages, configurations, and private keys) to another device on the same local network, enabling seamless migration to new hardware or backup of critical radio operation data. They generate a QR code or shortcode on their device, which the other device scans or enters to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection and transfer all selected data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two devices are on the same local network with their ham radio HTTP applications open, **When** the source device selects data to transfer and generates a QR code, **Then** the target device can scan the code and receive the selected data
2. **Given** a QR code cannot be scanned (damaged screen, poor lighting), **When** the source device generates a shortcode instead, **Then** the target device can manually enter the code to establish connection
3. **Given** devices are transferring a complete station backup, **When** the transfer is in progress, **Then** both devices see real-time progress indicators
4. **Given** a connection is established, **When** the source selects all station data including private keys, **Then** the target device receives everything needed to resume operations
5. **Given** a device is being replaced, **When** full station migration is performed, **Then** the new device can continue operations with the same identity and history

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network connection is lost mid-transfer? (System restarts transfer from beginning)
- How does system handle when QR code/shortcode expires? (Must generate new code after 5 minutes)
- What if multiple operators try to connect with the same code? (One-to-one only, first connection wins)
- How does system handle incompatible data formats between different versions? (Version compatibility check before transfer)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow operators to select specific logbook entries or data sets for transfer
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate both QR codes and human-readable shortcodes for connection establishment
- **FR-003**: System MUST establish peer-to-peer connections over local networks without internet access
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that both parties are on the same local network before allowing transfer
- **FR-015**: System MUST encrypt all transferred data using public key encryption when not using SSL/TLS
- **FR-016**: System MUST verify recipient identity through public key exchange before sensitive data transfer
- **FR-005**: Recipients MUST be able to preview data before accepting transfer
- **FR-006**: System MUST show real-time transfer progress to both sender and receiver
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle interrupted transfers by restarting from the beginning
- **FR-008**: QR codes and shortcodes MUST expire after 5 minutes for security
- **FR-009**: System MUST support transfer of all station data including logbooks, messages, contacts, settings, radio configurations, and private keys for complete device migration
- **FR-010**: System MUST limit connections to one-to-one transfers only (no concurrent connections)
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate data integrity after transfer completion
- **FR-012**: System MUST merge duplicate entries intelligently, preserving the most complete data from both sources
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all transfers for record keeping (station IDs not required as no RF transmission occurs)
- **FR-014**: System MUST support unlimited transfer sizes, constrained only by available network bandwidth and device storage

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transfer Session**: Represents a data transfer between two devices, includes connection code, participants, selected data, and transfer status
- **Station Data**: Complete set of operator data including logbooks, messages, contacts, configurations, and private keys
- **Logbook Entry**: Amateur radio contact record containing date, time, frequency, mode, callsigns, and signal reports
- **Connection Code**: Either a QR code representation or shortcode that initiates peer discovery and connection (5-minute expiration)
- **Transfer Data Package**: Collection of all selected station data formatted for complete device migration
- **Transfer Log**: Audit record of all data transfers for compliance and troubleshooting
