# Feature Specification: Visual Page Builder

**Feature Branch**: `006-visual-page-builder`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "visual page builder"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to create web pages for their amateur radio station by visually arranging components without writing code, enabling them to build informational pages, contact forms, and content displays that can be served over ham radio HTTP connections.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the visual page builder is open, **When** a user drags a text component onto the canvas, **Then** the component appears at the drop location in the grid and can be edited
2. **Given** a page has been created with multiple components, **When** the user saves the page, **Then** the page is stored as part of the callsign's multi-page site and can be served via the HTTP-over-radio server
3. **Given** a user has arranged components on the page, **When** they preview the page, **Then** they see how it will appear when served over radio with responsive design
4. **Given** a form component has been added, **When** the user configures form fields, **Then** the form can accept input when served
5. **Given** a page exceeds bandwidth limits, **When** the user attempts to save, **Then** they receive a warning about size constraints
6. **Given** a user has created a page layout, **When** they save it as a template, **Then** the template can be recalled for creating new pages
7. **Given** multiple pages exist for a callsign, **When** a user navigates between pages, **Then** they can edit any page within the site

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user deletes a component and uses undo?
- How does system handle importing/exporting templates between callsigns?
- How are grid conflicts resolved when components are placed?
- What happens when bandwidth-optimized output fails validation?
- How does the system handle page deletion in a multi-page site?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a visual canvas with grid layout where users can place and arrange page components
- **FR-002**: System MUST support drag-and-drop placement of components onto the grid-based page canvas
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide all HTML component types including text, images, forms, tables, lists, buttons, links, and containers
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to edit component properties with basic mode (text content) and advanced mode (styling, alignment)
- **FR-005**: System MUST save page designs in a format compatible with radio transmission bandwidth limits
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide preview functionality showing responsive pages as they will appear when served
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate pages against bandwidth constraints (2KB typical limit per ham radio specs)
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to save and load page designs for later editing within their callsign's site
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate bandwidth-optimized HTML suitable for radio transmission
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multi-page sites with one site per callsign
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to resize components within grid layout constraints following HTML layout rules
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle component positioning using HTML flow layout (no overlapping components)
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to create, save, and recall their own page templates
- **FR-014**: System MUST support responsive design by default for different screen sizes
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to duplicate/copy components within and between pages
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide undo/redo functionality for all editing operations
- **FR-017**: System MUST manage navigation between multiple pages within a callsign's site
- **FR-018**: Users MUST be able to export and import templates for sharing between callsigns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Site**: Multi-page website associated with a single callsign, containing all pages and shared resources
- **Page**: Individual web page within a site with components, grid layout, metadata, and bandwidth-optimized output
- **Component**: HTML element (text, form, image, table, list, button, link, container) with grid position, basic/advanced properties, and content
- **Grid Canvas**: Visual workspace using CSS Grid for component arrangement with responsive breakpoints
- **Page Template**: User-created reusable page layout with component structure and styling that can be saved and recalled
- **Component Library**: Collection of all available HTML component types users can add to pages
- **Edit History**: Undo/redo stack for tracking all editing operations within a session
