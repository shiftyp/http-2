# Feature Specification: Distributed Servers for Internet Resilience

**Feature Branch**: `017-distributed-servers`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Purpose**: Enable decentralized HTTP-over-radio network operation during internet outages via PWA-bundled local server

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse feature requirements
   → Distributed server capability via companion binary
2. PWA installation includes server binary
   → Binary bundled as asset in PWA
3. User prompted to run local server
   → One-click download and execution instructions
4. Local server provides true HTTP capabilities
   → Binds ports, accepts connections, bridges RF to IP
5. Establish peer coordination
   → Local servers discover each other via mDNS/RF
6. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need during internet outages
- Avoid implementation details (no tech stack specifics)
- Written for emergency communication scenarios

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a licensed ham radio operator, I want to run a local HTTP server (downloaded through the PWA) that enables my station to become part of a distributed network when internet connectivity is lost, so that licensed operators can maintain a self-contained web of HTTP servers accessible via radio.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a licensed operator has installed the PWA, **When** they access the distributed server feature, **Then** they can download and run the companion server binary after certificate validation
2. **Given** internet connectivity is lost, **When** licensed operators run their local servers, **Then** the servers form a distributed mesh using mDNS and RF communications
3. **Given** multiple licensed stations have servers running, **When** a station requests content, **Then** the system routes to the nearest/strongest signal source
4. **Given** a licensed operator creates new content while offline, **When** other server-running stations come within range, **Then** the content automatically synchronizes across the mesh
5. **Given** internet connectivity returns, **When** stations detect restoration, **Then** they seamlessly resume normal operations while maintaining local mesh capabilities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network partitions occur (two separate mesh networks)? System maintains separate networks until RF bridge available, then auto-merges with conflict resolution
- How does system handle conflicting content versions? Latest timestamp wins with option to preserve both versions with different URLs
- What if no stations have certain content? System returns 404 with list of available content on mesh
- How to prevent infinite routing loops? TTL on requests and loop detection via request ID tracking

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: PWA MUST bundle platform-specific server binaries as downloadable assets
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify amateur radio license certificate before allowing server download
- **FR-003**: Server binary MUST be signed and verified for integrity before execution
- **FR-004**: Licensed operators MUST explicitly opt-in to run the local server component
- **FR-005**: Local server MUST bind to configurable ports (default 8080) for HTTP service
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect internet connectivity loss within 30 seconds
- **FR-007**: Local servers MUST discover each other via mDNS on local network when internet is unavailable
- **FR-008**: Each server MUST maintain a local content cache of frequently accessed resources
- **FR-009**: Servers MUST synchronize content catalogs with peers via RF and local network
- **FR-010**: System MUST route HTTP requests through mesh to find requested content
- **FR-011**: Content MUST be replicated across multiple server nodes for redundancy
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual indication of server status and network mode

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Service discovery must complete within 5 seconds of station joining mesh
- **NFR-002**: Content synchronization must use less than 10% of available bandwidth
- **NFR-003**: System must support minimum 50 stations in distributed mode
- **NFR-004**: Content routing decisions must be made within 500ms

### Key Entities
- **Server Binary**: Platform-specific executable bundled with PWA, cryptographically signed for verification
- **License Certificate**: Amateur radio license validation for server activation
- **Local Server Instance**: Native HTTP server running on operator's machine, bridges PWA to network
- **Content Catalog**: Index of all content available on a server, includes URLs, content hashes, timestamps, size, and priority level
- **Mesh Directory**: Real-time map of all active servers and their available content, updated via mDNS and RF beacons
- **Replication Policy**: Rules determining which content to cache locally based on access frequency, content priority, and available storage
- **Service Beacon**: Periodic broadcast (mDNS locally, RF for distant nodes) announcing server presence and content summary
- **Content Request**: HTTP request that can be served locally or routed through mesh to appropriate server

## Distributed Architecture Patterns

### Server Installation Flow
1. **PWA Installation**: User installs PWA, which includes server binaries as assets
2. **License Verification**: User provides amateur radio certificate for validation
3. **Binary Download**: PWA enables download of platform-appropriate server binary
4. **Local Execution**: User runs server binary, which connects back to PWA
5. **Network Formation**: Server discovers other servers via mDNS and RF

### Peer Roles (Licensed Operators Only)
1. **Server Operator**: Licensed amateur running local HTTP server
2. **Content Origin**: Server that created/owns specific content
3. **Content Mirror**: Server replicating content for redundancy
4. **Relay Node**: Server forwarding requests/responses between distant peers
5. **Client-Only**: Unlicensed users who can browse but not serve content

### Content Categories
1. **Essential** (Priority 1): Emergency info, contact lists, critical updates - replicated everywhere
2. **Popular** (Priority 2): Frequently accessed pages - replicated based on demand
3. **Standard** (Priority 3): Regular content - cached opportunistically
4. **Personal** (Priority 4): User-specific content - stored at origin only

### Synchronization Strategies
- **Push**: High-priority content actively broadcast to all stations
- **Pull**: Stations request specific content based on local needs
- **Gossip**: Stations exchange catalogs and sync opportunistically
- **Predictive**: Pre-cache content based on access patterns

## Notes for Implementation Planning

This feature enables true decentralized operation where every station becomes both client and server, creating a resilient mesh of HTTP servers that can operate indefinitely without internet connectivity. The system should be transparent to users - they simply access `http://callsign.radio/` URLs whether internet is available or not.

Key principle: "Every station a server, every server a peer, every peer a backup."
