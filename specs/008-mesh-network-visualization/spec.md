# Feature Specification: Mesh Network Visualization

**Feature Branch**: `008-mesh-network-visualization`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "mesh network visualization"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Ham radio operators need to visualize their mesh network topology to understand station connectivity, identify communication paths, and troubleshoot network issues. The visualization helps operators see which stations are directly connected, which routes are available for communication, and how network changes affect overall connectivity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a mesh network with multiple connected stations, **When** the operator views the network visualization, **Then** they can see all stations as nodes with connection lines showing active routes
2. **Given** stations are communicating, **When** packets are being routed through the mesh, **Then** the visualization shows active data flow with visual indicators (colors, animations, or highlighting)
3. **Given** a station becomes unreachable, **When** the network topology changes, **Then** the visualization updates in real-time to reflect the new connectivity state
4. **Given** multiple possible routes to a destination, **When** viewing the network map, **Then** the visualization highlights the optimal path being used for communication

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a station has intermittent connectivity (weak signal, fading)?
- How does the system handle visualization of large networks with 50+ stations?
- What occurs when network partitions create isolated groups of stations?
- How are mesh routing failures and error conditions displayed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all active mesh network stations as visual nodes
- **FR-002**: System MUST show connection links between stations that can communicate directly

- **FR-005**: System MUST indicate signal strength or link quality between connected stations
- **FR-006**: System MUST show the routing path for multi-hop communications
- **FR-007**: System MUST display station identification (callsigns) on each network node
- **FR-008**: System MUST differentiate between direct RF connections and internet-assisted connections with distinct visual styling
- **FR-009**: System MUST display different amateur radio frequency bands and specific frequencies used for each connection
- **FR-010**: System MUST visualize radio wave propagation based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and distance between stations
- **FR-011**: System MUST utilize GPS location data from devices when available for accurate geographic positioning
- **FR-012**: System MUST display connection protocols (VARA, Winlink, packet radio, etc.) for each active link
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide zoom capability for viewing network details at different scales

- **FR-016**: System MUST display real-time statistics including throughput, SNR, and propagation conditions
- **FR-017**: System MUST show RF-specific data including signal strength, frequency, and power levels
- **FR-018**: System MUST map network health indicators to propagation characteristics (throughput, SNR, power)
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle network topology changes gracefully without disrupting the user experience

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Station Node**: Represents a ham radio station in the mesh, includes callsign, GPS coordinates, equipment details, and RF characteristics
- **Connection Link**: Represents communication capability between two stations, includes frequency, protocol, signal quality, connection type (RF/internet), and propagation visualization
- **Route Path**: Represents the actual path data takes through the mesh network for multi-hop communications with hop-by-hop signal analysis
- **Network Topology**: The overall structure and connectivity state of the mesh network with real-time propagation conditions
- **RF Propagation**: Visual representation of radio wave coverage based on power, frequency, terrain, and atmospheric conditions
- **Traffic Flow**: Real-time data indicating active communications, throughput, and network utilization across links
