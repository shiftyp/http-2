# Feature Specification: Station Setup Wizard

**Feature Branch**: `004-station-setup-wizard`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "station setup wizard"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator setting up the HTTP-over-Ham-Radio application for the first time, I want a guided step-by-step wizard that helps me configure my radio connection, test audio levels, verify PTT operation, and validate that everything is working correctly, so that I can start using the system without needing to understand complex technical settings or troubleshoot common configuration problems on my own.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user has installed the application, **When** they launch it for the first time, **Then** the setup wizard automatically starts and guides them through configuration
2. **Given** the user has a radio connected via serial cable, **When** they reach the radio detection step, **Then** the wizard automatically detects the radio model and connection settings
3. **Given** the user is on the audio calibration step, **When** they adjust their audio levels, **Then** they see real-time visual feedback showing signal strength and quality
4. **Given** the user completes all wizard steps successfully, **When** they click finish, **Then** their settings are saved and they can make their first transmission
5. **Given** a user encounters a problem during setup, **When** they click the help button, **Then** they see context-sensitive troubleshooting guidance
6. **Given** an experienced user launches the application, **When** they want to skip the wizard, **Then** they can bypass it and configure settings manually

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no radio is detected on any serial port?
- How does system handle unsupported radio models?
- What occurs when audio levels are too high or too low?
- How does the wizard handle PTT conflicts with other software?
- What happens if the user's callsign is invalid or not yet assigned?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an automatic setup wizard on first launch
- **FR-002**: Wizard MUST detect connected radios by scanning available serial ports
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify radio manufacturer and model from serial communication
- **FR-004**: Wizard MUST provide visual audio level calibration with real-time feedback
- **FR-005**: System MUST test PTT (Push-To-Talk) functionality with user confirmation
- **FR-006**: Wizard MUST validate user's amateur radio callsign format
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to test configuration with a local loopback transmission
- **FR-008**: Wizard MUST save all configuration settings upon successful completion
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide context-sensitive help at each wizard step
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to re-run the wizard from settings menu
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow experienced users to skip the wizard
- **FR-012**: Wizard MUST detect and warn about common configuration problems
- **FR-013**: System MUST remember completed wizard steps and allow going back
- **FR-014**: Wizard MUST support all possible radio models with searchable database
- **FR-015**: System MUST complete wizard in under 5 minutes for typical setup
- **FR-016**: Audio calibration MUST achieve signal quality matching FT8 best practices (SNR >-24dB, audio level between -10dB and 0dB)
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle concurrent serial port access using shared access when possible, with fallback to exclusive lock if required

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Station Configuration**: Represents a complete radio station setup including radio model, serial port, audio settings, PTT configuration, and operator callsign
- **Radio Profile**: Pre-defined settings for specific radio models including command protocols, baud rates, and capabilities
- **Wizard Progress**: Tracks which steps have been completed, validation results, and allows resuming interrupted setup
- **Audio Calibration**: Stores optimal audio input/output levels, sampling rates, and signal quality metrics
- **Connection Test Result**: Records successful connections, transmission tests, and any detected issues
