## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator, I want to receive dynamic updates (emergency information, weather data, station status) efficiently over the radio network, with automatic retry mechanisms when updates are missed, so that critical information reaches all interested parties reliably even with poor propagation conditions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an emergency update is created by a licensed station, **When** the update is broadcast over RF, **Then** all subscribed stations within range receive and cache the update
2. **Given** a station has subscribed to weather updates, **When** new weather data is available, **Then** the station receives notification via beacon and can retrieve the data
3. **Given** a licensed station missed an update due to poor propagation, **When** it detects the missing update from a beacon, **Then** it can request a retry from other licensed stations
4. **Given** an unlicensed station needs an update, **When** it requests via signaling server, **Then** a licensed station provides the data via WebRTC
5. **Given** multiple stations need the same missed update, **When** retry requests are made, **Then** a single coordinated retransmission serves all requesting stations
6. **Given** an update has different priority levels, **When** transmitted, **Then** higher priority updates get more reliable carriers and more retry attempts
7. **Given** a relay station receives an update, **When** local subscribers exist, **Then** the relay caches and retransmits based on priority
8. **Given** no station receives an initial update, **When** timeout expires, **Then** the originator automatically retries with different parameters

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all retry attempts fail due to propagation?
- How does system handle conflicting versions of the same update?
- What occurs when storage capacity is exceeded at relay stations? (Evict lowest priority first, then oldest)
- How are updates delivered to offline subscribers when they reconnect? (Available for cache expiration period)
- What happens when an unlicensed station requests data but no licensed station is available?
- How does system prevent retry storms when many stations miss the same update?
- How does system choose between WebRTC and RF when both are available?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Update Creation and Distribution
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow licensed stations to create dynamic updates with unique identifiers
- **FR-002**: System MUST broadcast updates proactively to known subscribers
- **FR-003**: System MUST support priority levels (P0-P5) for different update types
- **FR-004**: System MUST include routing hints in transmissions for targeted delivery
- **FR-005**: Updates MUST include version numbers for tracking missed updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST support batch transmission of multiple updates

#### Subscription Management
- **FR-007**: Stations MUST be able to subscribe to specific update categories
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain subscriber lists for each update type
- **FR-009**: Subscriptions MUST be persistent until explicitly cancelled by the subscriber
- **FR-010**: System MUST notify originators of active subscribers

#### Retry and Recovery Mechanisms
- **FR-011**: Licensed stations MUST be able to request retries for missed updates
- **FR-012**: System MUST support on-demand retries triggered by licensed stations (not automated)
- **FR-013**: Retry requests MUST be authenticated using ECDSA signatures from licensed stations
- **FR-014**: System MUST coordinate multiple retry requests using 10-30 second windows with random backoff to avoid collisions
- **FR-015**: Licensed stations MUST respond to valid retry requests when they have the data
- **FR-016**: Licensed stations MAY retry as needed using amateur radio operator judgment for appropriate frequency and timing

#### Caching and Relay
- **FR-017**: Relay stations MUST cache updates based on priority and local subscribers
- **FR-018**: Cached updates MUST expire based on priority tier (P0: 30 days, P1: 7 days, P2: 24 hours, P3-P5: 1 hour)
- **FR-019**: Relay stations MUST echo P0 and P1 priority updates automatically
- **FR-020**: System MUST track which stations have cached specific updates

#### Unlicensed Station Support
- **FR-021**: Unlicensed stations MUST be able to receive updates via WebRTC from licensed stations
- **FR-022**: Unlicensed stations MUST NOT be able to redistribute or seed data
- **FR-023**: Licensed stations MUST serve data to unlicensed requesters when designated
- **FR-024**: System MUST track unlicensed subscribers separately

#### Update Notification
- **FR-025**: System MUST only rebroadcast updates on request, except P0 emergency updates which MUST rebroadcast at configurable intervals (default 5 minutes)
- **FR-026**: Beacons MUST include update ID, version, and holder information
- **FR-027**: System MUST support both RF and internet-based notifications
- **FR-028**: Notifications MUST include enough metadata for stations to determine if they need the update

#### Data Integrity and Validation
- **FR-029**: Updates MUST include checksums or hashes for verification
- **FR-030**: System MUST validate update authenticity before caching or relaying
- **FR-031**: System MUST resolve version conflicts by using highest version number with timestamp as tiebreaker
- **FR-032**: Updates MUST include timestamps for ordering and expiration

#### Performance Requirements
- **FR-033**: Emergency updates (P0) MUST begin transmission within 3 seconds of creation
- **FR-034**: System MUST handle at least 100 concurrent updates (typical Raspberry Pi or modern phone capacity)
- **FR-035**: Retry coordination MUST complete within 30 seconds
- **FR-036**: Update size MUST be configurable with a default maximum of 50KB per update

#### Delivery Path Selection
- **FR-037**: System MUST prefer WebRTC over RF when available to reduce RF channel pressure
- **FR-038**: System MUST respect original delivery path - if RF was the last heard beacon path to originating station, continue using RF
- **FR-039**: System MUST fall back to RF when WebRTC connections are unavailable or stale

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Dynamic Update**: Time-sensitive data with ID, version, priority, content, and metadata
- **Subscription**: Relationship between station and update category with expiration
- **Retry Request**: Authenticated request from licensed station for missing update
- **Update Cache**: Temporary storage at relay stations with priority-based retention
- **Update Beacon**: Lightweight notification of available updates
- **Holder Registry**: List of stations that have cached specific updates
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Acknowledgment that update was received successfully
- **Update Version**: Sequential identifier for tracking update evolution

## Notes
This specification addresses the need for dynamic server-side data handling in the ham radio HTTP system. The key innovation is a proactive push model where updates are broadcast to subscribers immediately, with intelligent retry mechanisms when stations miss updates. Licensed stations can request retries on behalf of themselves or relay networks, while unlicensed stations can receive data via WebRTC but cannot redistribute it.

The system prioritizes emergency and safety-critical updates while supporting routine data like weather and station status. By leveraging both RF and internet channels, the system ensures reliable delivery even in challenging propagation conditions.
