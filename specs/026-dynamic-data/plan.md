## Summary
Implement a dynamic data distribution system for ham radio networks that enables efficient delivery of time-sensitive updates (emergency alerts, weather data, station status) through a combination of RF broadcast, WebRTC peer-to-peer transfer, and intelligent retry mechanisms. The system prioritizes updates based on content type, respects FCC regulations by ensuring only licensed stations can transmit, and provides path-aware delivery that chooses between RF and internet channels based on availability and recent beacon activity.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / JavaScript ES2022
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, IndexedDB, WebRTC, Web Audio API, Web Serial API
**Storage**: IndexedDB for update caching, signaling server SQLite for metadata
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, contract testing for protocols
**Target Platform**: Progressive Web App (browser-based) + Node.js signaling server
**Project Type**: web - PWA frontend + lightweight signaling backend
**Performance Goals**: 3-second emergency update transmission, 100 concurrent updates
**Constraints**: 50KB max update size, 2.8 kHz RF bandwidth, FCC Part 97 compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Support 100+ stations, handle P0-P5 priority updates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Research & Analysis → research.md
Investigate existing codebase for integration points:
- How content registry handles beacons
- WebRTC transport implementation
- OFDM carrier allocation for priority data
- Signaling server extension points
- FCC compliance requirements for retries

### Phase 1: Technical Design → contracts, models, quickstart
Design the complete system architecture:
- API contracts for subscriptions and updates
- Data models for updates, subscriptions, retry requests
- Integration with existing beacon/content systems
- WebRTC negotiation for licensed station transfers
- Quickstart guide for operators

### Phase 2: Task Planning → tasks.md (via /tasks command)
**Approach for task generation:**

The /tasks command will create detailed implementation tasks following TDD principles:

1. **Contract Tests First** (T01-T15)
   - Update creation and validation
   - Subscription management endpoints
   - Retry request protocol
   - WebRTC negotiation for updates
   - Priority-based delivery rules

2. **Integration Tests** (T16-T25)
   - End-to-end update flow from creation to delivery
   - RF to WebRTC fallback scenarios
   - Cache eviction under pressure
   - Retry coordination with collision avoidance
   - Multi-station update distribution

3. **Library Implementation** (T26-T45)
   - Each library gets 3-4 tasks:
     - Core functionality
     - CLI implementation
     - Documentation (llms.txt format)
     - Unit tests

4. **Signaling Server Extensions** (T46-T50)
   - Subscription API endpoints
   - Update holder tracking
   - Retry coordination service

5. **UI Components** (T51-T55)
   - Update monitoring dashboard
   - Subscription manager interface
   - Retry request UI for operators

Each task will include:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Test-first requirement
- Estimated effort (S/M/L)
- Dependencies on other tasks

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Constitution compliance verified
- [x] Technical context established
- [x] Phase 0: Research (complete - research.md)
- [x] Phase 1: Technical Design (complete - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task Planning (ready for /tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation (future)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration (future)

## Complexity Tracking
No constitutional violations identified. System uses existing infrastructure (WebRTC, signaling server, RF protocols) with minimal new complexity. Priority-based delivery and retry mechanisms are essential for reliable emergency communications.

## Risk Assessment
1. **RF Collision Risk**: Multiple retry responses could collide - mitigated by coordination windows
2. **Storage Limits**: Relay stations might run out of space - handled by eviction policy
3. **WebRTC Reliability**: P2P connections may fail - fallback to RF always available
4. **FCC Compliance**: All retries must be from licensed stations - enforced via ECDSA signatures

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 0 research into existing systems
2. Design API contracts and data models
3. Run /tasks command to generate implementation tasks
4. Begin TDD implementation with contract tests first
