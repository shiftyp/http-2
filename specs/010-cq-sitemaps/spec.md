# Feature Specification: CQ Sitemaps for Content Discovery

**Feature Branch**: `010-cq-sitemaps`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "cq sitemaps"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Radio operators need to discover what content is available on other stations in the mesh network without making individual requests to each station. Instead of blindly requesting URLs and receiving 404 errors, operators can receive periodic sitemap broadcasts that announce available content, file sizes, and freshness indicators across the mesh network.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a station has web content available, **When** it broadcasts a sitemap via CQ message, **Then** other stations in range receive and cache the content inventory
2. **Given** multiple stations in a mesh network, **When** each broadcasts their sitemap, **Then** stations can route content requests directly to known content holders
3. **Given** a station receives a sitemap broadcast, **When** the content list changes on the originating station, **Then** an updated sitemap is broadcast within a reasonable timeframe
4. **Given** a user wants to access specific content, **When** they query available content, **Then** the system shows what's available across the mesh without making network requests

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sitemap broadcasts collide or overlap in timing?
- How does the system handle outdated sitemap information when stations go offline?
- What occurs when content becomes unavailable between sitemap broadcast and actual request?
- How are large sitemaps handled within bandwidth constraints?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST broadcast periodic sitemap messages containing available content URLs and metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST propagate received sitemaps through the mesh network with appropriate time-to-live controls
- **FR-003**: System MUST cache received sitemap information locally for content discovery
- **FR-004**: System MUST include content metadata in sitemaps (file size, ETag, last modified)
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect bandwidth limitations when broadcasting sitemaps [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific bandwidth limits and sitemap size constraints]
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a way for users to query available content across the mesh without network requests
- **FR-007**: System MUST update cached sitemap data when stations become unavailable [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeout duration and detection method]
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent sitemap broadcast loops and excessive propagation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific loop prevention mechanism]
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with existing mesh routing to enable content-aware request forwarding
- **FR-010**: System MUST broadcast sitemaps at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: broadcast frequency not specified - every 30 minutes? on content change?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sitemap Entry**: Represents a piece of available content with URL, size, ETag, timestamp, and originating station callsign
- **Sitemap Cache**: Local storage of received sitemap data with TTL and freshness tracking
- **CQ Sitemap Message**: Broadcast message format containing sitemap entries with mesh propagation metadata
- **Content Discovery Index**: Queryable index of available content across all known stations in the mesh
