## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Amateur radio operator certificate management system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: server operators, client users, certificate authorities

   � Constraints: radio bandwidth, FCC compliance, trust verification
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Certificate types supported (LoTW, ARRL, self-signed)
   � CAPTCHA verification for all certificate requests
   � Server operator approval workflow
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Client certificate generation/upload flow
   � Server operator approval workflow
   � CAPTCHA verification process
5. Generate Functional Requirements

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an amateur radio operator, I need to add my callsign certificate to the application so I can prove my licensed status when connecting to servers. As a server operator, I need to verify and approve certificates to ensure only legitimate operators access my server.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a client user with a LoTW P12 certificate file, **When** they upload the certificate and enter the password, **Then** the certificate is parsed and stored locally
2. **Given** a client with multiple certificates, **When** connecting to a server, **Then** they can select which station info to transmit from their list
3. **Given** a client connecting to a server for the first time, **When** the connection is established, **Then** the client automatically sends a certificate request with selected station information
4. **Given** a server receives a certificate request, **When** it includes a valid signed CAPTCHA solution, **Then** the request appears in the server operator's approval queue
5. **Given** a server operator reviewing a certificate request, **When** they approve it, **Then** the client receives approval and gains server access
6. **Given** a client without an existing certificate, **When** they choose to generate one, **Then** a self-signed certificate is created with their callsign
7. **Given** a certificate request with an invalid CAPTCHA solution, **When** processed by the server, **Then** the request is rejected with an error message
8. **Given** a server hearing a CQ from a banned station, **When** configured to do so, **Then** it broadcasts the ban information
9. **Given** a client switching certificates during a session, **When** they select a different certificate, **Then** a new session is started

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a certificate is already registered for a callsign?
- How does system handle expired or revoked certificates?
- What occurs if CAPTCHA attempts exceed the rate limit (delay until next attempt allowed)?
- How are special event or club callsigns handled (shared certificates for clubs)?
- What happens when no server operator is available to approve certificates?
- How do servers share trusted certificate lists between each other?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support three certificate types: self-signed (generated by app), ARRL certificates, and LoTW certificates
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate CAPTCHA challenges for verifying humanness (simple math, patterns, basic ham knowledge)
- **FR-003**: Server operators MUST be able to review, approve, or reject certificate requests
- **FR-004**: Clients MUST automatically send certificate requests when connecting to a new server
- **FR-005**: System MUST verify CAPTCHA solutions before allowing certificate approval
- **FR-006**: System MUST store approved certificates permanently on the server without private keys
- **FR-007**: System MUST rate limit CAPTCHA attempts per callsign (3 attempts per hour with delay after limit)
- **FR-008**: Server operators MUST be able to revoke/ban certificates at their discretion
- **FR-009**: System MUST display certificate authority information (LoTW, ARRL, self-signed) to help operator decisions
- **FR-010**: Clients MUST support multiple certificates for different callsigns (special events, club stations)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support PKCS#12 format for LoTW certificate uploads with password protection
- **FR-012**: Certificates MUST be portable across all servers (same certificate used everywhere)
- **FR-013**: System MUST track trust levels: self-signed < ARRL < LoTW
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate certificate chain for ARRL and LoTW certificates
- **FR-015**: Server operators MUST see pending requests with station information (callsign, location, license class)
- **FR-016**: Servers MUST accept certificate lists from servers with trusted certificate lineage
- **FR-017**: System MUST broadcast banned certificate info when hearing CQ from banned station (configurable)
- **FR-018**: Server operators MUST manually process banned certificate broadcasts (can unban for their server)
- **FR-019**: Certificate approvals MUST require active server operator presence (no auto-approve)
- **FR-020**: System MUST support transfer/export of certificate lists in custom compressed format
- **FR-021**: Clients MUST be able to select primary certificate and switch between certificates (new session)
- **FR-022**: CAPTCHA solutions MUST be signed by originating certificate and valid forever
- **FR-023**: Signed CAPTCHA solutions MUST be verifiable by any server with trust chain validation
- **FR-024**: Server owner certificates MUST be regular client certificates used to establish trust chains
- **FR-025**: Self-signed certificates verified by trusted server owners MUST have same trust level as origin
- **FR-026**: Certificate exports MUST use compressed format with signatures and checksums for validation
- **FR-027**: Trust chain depth MUST be limited to prevent attacks while allowing reasonable federation
- **FR-028**: Certificate data MUST be stored per-certificate allowing background processing during switches
- **FR-029**: Ban broadcasts MUST trigger for direct and relayed CQs (once for historical CQs)
- **FR-030**: Servers MUST be able to request most trusted certificate from multi-cert clients
- **FR-031**: Multiple certificates per callsign MUST default to most trusted for that callsign
- **FR-032**: First server certificate MUST be created by installing client and transferred during server setup (bootstrap)
- **FR-033**: System MUST distinguish between revoked (invalid) and banned (valid but blocked) certificates
- **FR-034**: Certificate owners MUST be able to self-revoke their own certificates
- **FR-035**: CAPTCHA pools MUST be managed by originating servers with random generation
- **FR-036**: Server operators MUST be able to add custom CAPTCHA challenges to their pool
- **FR-037**: Certificates MUST be verifiable offline using cached certificate database from PWA installation
- **FR-038**: Certificate metadata MUST contain only callsign and license class (no personal information)
- **FR-039**: Rate limiting MUST be per-server (3 attempts/hour) and removed after successful solve

### Key Entities
- **Certificate**: Represents an X.509 certificate with amateur radio extensions (callsign, license class, trust level)
- **Certificate Request**: A pending request from a client including certificate data, station info, and CAPTCHA status
- **CAPTCHA Challenge**: Radio-optimized verification challenge (math problems, patterns, basic ham knowledge)
- **Signed CAPTCHA Solution**: A CAPTCHA solution signed by originating certificate, valid forever across all trusting servers
- **Approval Record**: Server operator's decision on a certificate request with timestamp and trust level
- **Station Information**: Metadata about the requesting station (callsign, location, license class)
- **Certificate Database**: Cached list of certificates from original PWA installation server for offline verification
- **Ban Record**: Distinguished from revocation - certificate remains valid but is blocked on specific servers
- **Trust Chain**: Lineage of certificate trust relationships between servers with configurable maximum depth
