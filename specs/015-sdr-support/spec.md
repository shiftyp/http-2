## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT ham radio operators need for spectrum monitoring
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no specific SDR APIs, DSP algorithms)
- =e Written for amateur radio operators and emergency coordinators

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator, I want to connect an SDR device to monitor multiple frequency bands simultaneously for HTTP-over-radio transmissions, so that I can automatically discover and cache content chunks being transmitted across the mesh network without having to manually tune to each frequency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have an RTL-SDR dongle connected to my computer, **When** I start the application, **Then** the system detects the SDR device and begins monitoring all configured frequency ranges
2. **Given** the SDR is monitoring 40m and 20m bands, **When** another station transmits content chunks, **Then** the system automatically decodes and caches the chunks for redistribution
3. **Given** I'm monitoring multiple bands simultaneously, **When** I request content that was overheard on another band, **Then** the system serves the cached content immediately without needing to contact the original source
4. **Given** the SDR detects poor signal quality on one band, **When** good signals are available on other bands, **Then** the system automatically prioritizes the clearer frequency for monitoring
5. **Given** I want to analyze spectrum usage, **When** I view the monitoring dashboard, **Then** the system displays real-time waterfall plots and signal activity across all monitored bands

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the SDR device becomes disconnected during monitoring?
- How does the system handle SDR devices with limited bandwidth capability?
- What occurs when multiple SDR devices are connected simultaneously?
- How does the system prioritize processing when CPU resources are limited?
