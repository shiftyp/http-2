# Implementation Plan: SDR Support for Wide-Band Monitoring

**Branch**: `015-sdr-support` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/015-sdr-support/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Loaded successfully: SDR support for wide-band monitoring
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
SDR support for wide-band spectrum monitoring enabling automatic discovery and caching of HTTP-over-radio content chunks across multiple amateur radio frequency bands. Integrates with existing mesh networking and BitTorrent protocol for enhanced content distribution efficiency.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with ES2022 modules
**Primary Dependencies**: Web Audio API, WebAssembly (for SDR processing), existing QPSK modem library, IndexedDB
**Storage**: IndexedDB for chunk caching, configuration persistence
**Testing**: Vitest, existing test infrastructure
**Target Platform**: Progressive Web App (browser-based)
**Project Type**: web (extends existing PWA architecture)
**Performance Goals**: Real-time processing of 2.4-61.44 MHz bandwidth, <100ms decode latency, 70%+ test coverage
**Constraints**: FCC Part 97 compliance, browser security limitations, amateur radio bandwidth limits (2.8 kHz)
**Scale/Scope**: Support 5 SDR device types, monitor 5 frequency bands simultaneously, cache 1000+ content chunks

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (extend existing PWA project)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Web Audio API, existing libraries)
- Single data model? Yes (SDR monitoring integrates with existing chunk model)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct integration with existing architecture)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes (SDR support in `/src/lib/sdr-support/`)
- Libraries listed: sdr-device-manager, spectrum-monitor, signal-decoder, waterfall-display, auto-discovery-cache
- CLI per library: Browser-based configuration UI (no CLI needed for PWA)
- Library docs: Will update existing CLAUDE.md format

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (TDD mandatory per constitution)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Will enforce
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (mock SDR devices for testing, real Web Audio API)
- Integration tests for: SDR device integration, chunk caching, frequency monitoring
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (console logging for browser environment)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (PWA architecture, no backend)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (SDR errors, decode failures, device disconnections)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Will integrate with existing versioning
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes (follows existing CI/CD)
- Breaking changes handled? Yes (backward compatibility with existing mesh networking)
