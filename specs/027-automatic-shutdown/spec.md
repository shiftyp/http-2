## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a licensed amateur radio operator operating an automatic or remotely controlled station, I want the system to provide immediate shutdown capability and fail-safe mechanisms so that I can comply with FCC Part 97.213 requirements and maintain proper control authority over my station.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Remote Shutdown Control (§97.213)
1. **Given** station is operating in automatic mode, **When** control operator sends shutdown command remotely, **Then** system immediately terminates all transmissions and enters safe mode
2. **Given** station is transmitting automatically, **When** control operator is unreachable for monitoring period, **Then** system automatically shuts down transmission after timeout
3. **Given** emergency shutdown command is received, **When** system processes command, **Then** all RF output ceases within maximum allowed time limit
4. **Given** station is operating remotely, **When** control link is lost, **Then** system activates fail-safe shutdown procedure

#### Control Operator Monitoring (§97.213)
5. **Given** automatic station is active, **When** control operator monitoring session begins, **Then** system provides real-time status and control interface
6. **Given** control operator is monitoring, **When** station requires immediate attention, **Then** system alerts operator and requests acknowledgment
7. **Given** monitoring period expires, **When** no operator acknowledgment received, **Then** system initiates automatic shutdown sequence
8. **Given** third-party traffic is being handled, **When** control operator oversight is required, **Then** system prevents automatic relay until operator approval

#### Fail-Safe Operation (§97.213)
9. **Given** system detects equipment malfunction, **When** fault condition persists, **Then** automatic shutdown activates to prevent improper operation
10. **Given** station exceeds authorized operating parameters, **When** violation is detected, **Then** system immediately ceases transmission and logs event
11. **Given** emergency communications are in progress, **When** automatic shutdown would interrupt emergency traffic, **Then** system delays shutdown until emergency traffic concludes
12. **Given** station identification timer expires, **When** automatic station cannot transmit ID, **Then** system shuts down transmission until ID can be sent

### Edge Cases
- What happens during power failure or system crash? Fail-safe hardware switch required
- How to handle partial system failures? Graceful degradation with monitoring alerts
- What if remote control commands are corrupted? Command validation and acknowledgment required
- How to override automatic shutdown during emergencies? Emergency override with enhanced logging

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Remote Control Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide remote shutdown capability accessible by authorized control operator

## Notes

### FCC Part 97.213 Compliance Requirements
This specification addresses the automatic station and remote control requirements mandated by FCC Part 97.213:

1. **Remote Control Authority**: Control operator must have immediate shutdown capability
2. **Automatic Operation Limits**: Stations must not operate automatically beyond control operator oversight
3. **Fail-Safe Requirements**: Equipment must shut down automatically when operating improperly
4. **Third-Party Traffic**: Automatic handling requires enhanced control operator oversight

### Integration with Existing Compliance System
This feature extends the existing FCC compliance implementation (025-fcc-compliance-implementation) to cover automatic station operation requirements. It coordinates with:

- Station identification system for control operator ID requirements
- Transmission mode detection for remote vs local operation
- Content filtering for automatic third-party traffic handling
- Mesh networking for automatic relay control

### Emergency Communication Considerations
The automatic shutdown system must balance regulatory compliance with emergency communication needs:
- Emergency traffic takes priority over automatic shutdown
- Enhanced logging during emergency overrides
- Manual control operator override capability
- Coordination with emergency communication protocols

This specification ensures full FCC Part 97.213 compliance for automatic and remotely controlled amateur radio stations.
