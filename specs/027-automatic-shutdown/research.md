# Research: Automatic Shutdown

## Executive Summary
Research findings for implementing FCC Part 97.213 compliant automatic shutdown and remote control system. Focus on remote control protocols, control operator monitoring, fail-safe mechanisms, and integration with existing compliance infrastructure.

## Research Questions & Findings

### 1. FCC Part 97.213 Automatic Station Requirements
**Question**: What are the specific technical requirements for automatic station operation?

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive remote control authority with fail-safe mechanisms
- **Rationale**:
  - §97.213(a): Control operator must have ability to turn off station at any time
  - §97.213(b): Automatic operation only when control operator can monitor and control
  - §97.213(c): Station must automatically cease transmitting upon malfunction
  - Remote control link must be under control of amateur operator
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Manual operation only: Severely limits automation capabilities
  - Simplified monitoring: Insufficient for regulatory compliance
- **Implementation**: Multi-channel remote control with authentication and fail-safe hardware

### 2. Remote Control Protocol Standards
**Question**: Which remote control protocols and authentication methods are suitable?

**Decision**: Multi-modal remote control with cryptographic authentication
- **Rationale**:
  - Internet-based: WebSocket with TLS for primary remote access
  - RF-based: Control commands via existing QPSK/OFDM data protocol
  - Phone-based: DTMF tone sequences for backup access
  - Authentication: ECDSA signatures with time-based challenges
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single-channel control: Creates single point of failure
  - Weak authentication: Violates FCC control operator requirements
- **Implementation**: Redundant control channels with strong authentication

### 3. Fail-Safe Hardware Integration
**Question**: How to implement hardware-level fail-safe mechanisms in browser environment?

**Decision**: Web Serial API for hardware control with software coordination
- **Rationale**:
  - Hardware watchdog: External relay controlled via serial interface
  - Software monitoring: Web Serial API communicates with Arduino/microcontroller
  - Independent operation: Hardware fails safe if software crashes
  - Power backup: Hardware maintains fail-safe capability during power events
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Software-only: Insufficient for true fail-safe operation
  - Complex hardware: Beyond amateur radio DIY capabilities
- **Implementation**: Simple serial-controlled relay with heartbeat protocol

### 4. Control Operator Session Management
**Question**: How to track and validate control operator presence and authority?

**Decision**: Session-based monitoring with periodic acknowledgment requirements
- **Rationale**:
  - Active sessions: Control operator must maintain authenticated session
  - Periodic checks: System requires operator acknowledgment every 30 minutes
  - Automatic timeout: Session expires without activity, triggering shutdown
  - Multi-operator: Support for multiple authorized control operators
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Continuous monitoring: Too demanding on control operator
  - No timeout: Violates control operator responsibility requirements
- **Implementation**: Token-based sessions with renewal and heartbeat

### 5. Equipment Monitoring and Fault Detection
**Question**: What parameters should be monitored for automatic fault detection?

**Decision**: Comprehensive station parameter monitoring with configurable thresholds
- **Rationale**:
  - RF parameters: Power output, SWR, frequency deviation
  - System health: CPU usage, memory consumption, communication errors
  - Network status: Control link quality, internet connectivity
  - Custom limits: Operator-configurable thresholds for all parameters
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Minimal monitoring: Insufficient for fault detection
  - Fixed thresholds: Cannot adapt to different station configurations
- **Implementation**: Plugin-based monitoring system with configurable alerts

### 6. Integration with Existing Compliance System
**Question**: How to integrate with existing FCC compliance and transmission systems?

**Decision**: Event-driven integration with compliance manager as coordinator
- **Rationale**:
  - Compliance hooks: Automatic shutdown integrates with existing compliance manager
  - Transmission coordination: Works with transmission mode detection system
  - Audit integration: All shutdown events logged via existing compliance logging
  - Emergency coordination: Respects emergency communication priority
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Separate system: Creates compliance gaps and conflicts
  - Complete rewrite: Too disruptive to existing functionality
- **Implementation**: Event bus integration with existing compliance architecture

### Browser Integration
- **Minimum Requirements**:
  - Web Serial API for hardware control (Chrome 89+)
  - WebSocket support for remote control (all modern browsers)
  - IndexedDB for session persistence (all modern browsers)
  - Web Crypto API for authentication (Chrome 37+, Firefox 34+)

### Performance Targets (Validated)
