## Summary
Implement FCC Part 97.213 compliant automatic shutdown and remote control system for amateur radio stations, including fail-safe mechanisms, control operator monitoring, and emergency override capabilities. Critical for legal automatic station operation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / ES2022 modules
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing fcc-compliance, transmission-mode, crypto libraries
**Storage**: IndexedDB for control operator sessions and shutdown event logs
**Testing**: Vitest with contract/integration/unit tests
**Target Platform**: Progressive Web App (browser-based)
**Project Type**: single (PWA with offline-first architecture)
**Performance Goals**: <3s emergency shutdown, <1s status updates, <100ms command auth
**Constraints**: FCC Part 97.213 regulations, browser environment, real-time requirements
**Scale/Scope**: All automatic transmissions monitored, multiple control operators, fail-safe hardware

## Constitution Check

- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct implementation)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed:
  - `remote-control`: Remote control command processing and authentication

  - `control-operator`: Session management and operator authentication
- CLI per library: Each library will have test CLI
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? Yes

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (IndexedDB, existing compliance system)
- Integration tests for: remote control scenarios, automatic operation, fail-safe? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (comprehensive audit trail for FCC compliance)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (PWA architecture)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (detailed shutdown event logging)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes (backwards compatibility maintained)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project - PWA architecture per constitution)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - FCC Part 97.213 specific technical requirements and implementation details
   - Remote control protocol standards and authentication methods
   - Fail-safe hardware integration patterns for browser environment
   - Integration points with existing FCC compliance and transmission systems

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research FCC Part 97.213 automatic station requirements in detail"
   Task: "Find remote control protocols and authentication standards for amateur radio"
   Task: "Research fail-safe shutdown mechanisms and hardware integration"
   Task: "Analyze integration with existing compliance and transmission mode systems"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with technical implementation decisions

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - RemoteControlManager: Command processing and authentication
   - AutomaticStationController: Control operator monitoring
   - FailSafeShutdown: Emergency shutdown mechanisms
   - ControlOperatorSession: Session tracking and authentication
   - ShutdownEvent: Audit trail of all shutdown events
   - EquipmentMonitor: Station equipment status monitoring
   - EmergencyOverride: Emergency communication exceptions

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Remote control command protocol
   - Control operator monitoring interface
   - Fail-safe shutdown triggers
   - Emergency override procedures

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test remote shutdown command execution
   - Test control operator session management
   - Test fail-safe mechanism activation
   - Test emergency override behavior

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - 12 acceptance scenarios from specification
   - Emergency communication testing
   - Multi-operator control testing

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Add automatic shutdown concepts to CLAUDE.md

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate remote control library tasks
- Generate automatic station controller tasks
- Generate fail-safe shutdown tasks
- Generate control operator session management tasks
- Generate integration tasks with existing compliance system
- Generate control interface UI tasks
- Generate integration test tasks for all 12 acceptance scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Implementation → Integration
- Dependency order: Core libraries → Integration → UI → Testing
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where possible

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
