# Tasks: Automatic Shutdown

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/027-automatic-shutdown/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.x, IndexedDB, Web Crypto API, Web Serial API
   → Libraries: remote-control, automatic-station, fail-safe-shutdown, control-operator
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 7 entities identified
   → contracts/: 3 API endpoints defined
   → research.md: FCC regulations and technical decisions loaded
   → quickstart.md: 5 demo scenarios plus complete example
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: library structure, IndexedDB setup, hardware integration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, compliance scenarios
   → Core: remote control, automatic station, fail-safe shutdown, control operator
   → Integration: FCC compliance hooks, transmission mode coordination
   → Polish: unit tests, performance optimization, control UI
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T035)
6. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### FCC Part 97.213 Requirements
- **Remote Control**: Must provide immediate shutdown capability accessible by control operator
- **Session Monitoring**: Control operator sessions with mandatory timeouts and acknowledgment
- **Fail-Safe Hardware**: Independent hardware-level shutdown mechanisms via Web Serial API
- **Audit Trail**: Every automatic station action must be logged for FCC compliance

### Performance Targets
- Emergency shutdown: <3 seconds from command to RF cessation
- Status updates: <1 second for control operator interface
- Command authentication: <100ms for signature validation
- Hardware watchdog: <30 second heartbeat interval

### Integration Points
- Hook into existing `fcc-compliance` library for regulatory coordination
- Coordinate with `transmission-mode` library for RF vs WebRTC operation
- Integrate with `station-id-timer` for control operator identification
- Connect to existing compliance logging system

### Testing Strategy
- All 12 acceptance scenarios from spec must pass
- Performance tests for real-time emergency shutdown requirements
- FCC regulation compliance verification
- Hardware integration testing with mock serial devices

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino or compatible microcontroller for hardware watchdog
- Serial interface (USB) for software-hardware communication
- RF relay control for emergency shutdown capability
- Status indicators (LEDs) for hardware state display

## Emergency Considerations
- Emergency override allows emergency traffic to delay automatic shutdown
- Control operator authority still required during emergency operations
- All emergency activities logged with enhanced detail for post-event analysis
- Hardware fail-safe operates independently of software emergency override
