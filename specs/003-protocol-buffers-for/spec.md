# Feature Specification: Protocol Buffers for All Transmissions

**Feature Branch**: `003-protocol-buffers-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "protocol buffers for all transmissions. When API data is sent, first send a proto file, then send the data"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator using the HTTP over Ham Radio application, I want all dynamic data transmissions to use a structured binary format with dynamically generated schema definitions sent before the data, so that receiving stations can properly decode and validate incoming transmissions even if they haven't seen that data type before, improving interoperability across different station versions and reducing bandwidth usage through efficient binary encoding.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a sending station has dynamic API data to transmit, **When** the station initiates a transmission, **Then** it dynamically generates a schema definition file and sends it first, followed by the actual data encoded according to that schema
2. **Given** a receiving station receives an unknown data format, **When** it receives the dynamically generated schema file first, **Then** it can properly decode and validate the subsequent data transmission
3. **Given** a station has already received a schema definition, **When** it receives data with the same schema identifier, **Then** it uses the cached schema without requiring retransmission
4. **Given** bandwidth-limited radio conditions, **When** dynamic data is transmitted using the binary format, **Then** the total transmission size is smaller than equivalent JSON or XML formats

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a schema file transmission is interrupted or corrupted?
- How does system handle version mismatches between schema definitions?
- What occurs when a station receives data without the corresponding schema?
- How does the system manage schema storage limits on resource-constrained devices?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST dynamically generate schema definition files before transmitting dynamic data
- **FR-002**: System MUST encode all dynamic API data transmissions using binary serialization format
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide unique identifiers for each dynamically generated schema to enable caching
- **FR-004**: Receiving stations MUST be able to decode data using the dynamically generated schema definitions
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate incoming data against the corresponding schema
- **FR-006**: System MUST cache received schema definitions only for the duration of a page session and evict them when the session ends
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle schema version conflicts by always accepting the latest version, or re-requesting the schema when decode errors occur
- **FR-008**: System MUST request missing schemas from the originating station when not cached or when decoding errors occur
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect size constraints configured at transmission level (globally or per-component)
- **FR-010**: System MUST always request the latest schema from the originating station when decoding errors occur (no backward compatibility maintained)
- **FR-011**: System MUST compress schema definitions using the most efficient available compression method
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate schema definitions dynamically based on the structure of the data being transmitted
- **FR-013**: System MUST support requesting schemas after transmission when previously sent data cannot be decoded

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Schema Definition**: Dynamically generated description of the structure and validation rules for a specific data format, includes version identifier and field specifications
- **Binary Data Transmission**: The encoded data payload that follows the schema, contains the actual dynamic information being transmitted
- **Schema Cache**: Local storage of previously received schema definitions, indexed by unique identifiers
- **Transmission Packet**: Combined unit containing dynamically generated schema reference/definition and the corresponding binary data
