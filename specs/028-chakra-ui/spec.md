# Feature Specification: Chakra UI Component Migration

**Feature Branch**: `028-chakra-ui`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "chakra ui"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Migrate from custom Tailwind components to Chakra UI
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers, end users (radio operators)
   � Actions: replace components, maintain functionality, improve layouts
   � Data: existing component props/state, theme configuration
   � Constraints: preserve radio functionality, maintain PWA compatibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Migration scope: Complete migration of all UI components to Chakra UI
   � Theme requirements: Preserve existing dark radio operator aesthetic
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: developers use new components, end users see improved interface
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Component library, theme system, layout system
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a radio operator using the HTTP-over-Radio application, I want a consistent, accessible, and responsive user interface that works seamlessly across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) and maintains the professional radio operator aesthetic while providing better usability for managing radio communications, creating content, and monitoring radio networks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded on any device, **When** a user interacts with any UI component (buttons, forms, cards), **Then** the interface responds consistently with proper spacing, colors, and accessibility features
2. **Given** a user is creating content in the page builder, **When** they drag and drop components, **Then** the interface provides clear visual feedback and maintains responsive layout behavior
3. **Given** a user is viewing the application on a mobile device, **When** they navigate between different sections, **Then** all layouts adapt appropriately without losing functionality
4. **Given** a user is operating the radio controls, **When** they interact with frequency settings and transmission modes, **Then** the interface provides immediate visual feedback with consistent styling

### Edge Cases
- What happens when components need to display on very small radio displays (2-3 inch screens)?
- How does the system handle theme switching between light/dark modes for different operating conditions?
- What occurs when accessibility features (screen readers, keyboard navigation) are used with complex radio visualizations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide consistent visual design across all application components
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain responsive behavior on all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all existing radio functionality during component migration
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide improved accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain the dark theme optimized for radio operator use
- **FR-006**: System MUST support the existing drag-and-drop page builder functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain performance standards for real-time radio operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide better layout flexibility for transmitted pages over radio
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing radio-specific visualizations (waterfall displays, mesh networks)

### Key Entities
- **Component Library**: Collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, forms) with consistent styling and behavior
- **Theme System**: Centralized design tokens for colors, spacing, typography optimized for radio operator interface
- **Layout System**: Responsive grid and flexbox components that adapt to different screen sizes and radio display requirements
- **Accessibility Framework**: Built-in support for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and WCAG compliance
