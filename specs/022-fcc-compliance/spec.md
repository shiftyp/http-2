# Feature Specification: FCC Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `022-fcc-compliance`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fcc compliance"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Parsed: "fcc compliance" - regulatory compliance for amateur radio operations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: FCC Part 97 regulations, amateur radio, station identification, content restrictions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No ambiguities in regulatory requirements (Part 97 is well-defined)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows identified for station operators and automatic systems
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement maps to specific FCC Part 97 sections
   ’ All requirements are testable via log review or transmission monitoring
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Station identifiers, transmission logs, compliance records
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No uncertainties remain (FCC regulations are prescriptive)
   ’ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an amateur radio operator using the HTTP-over-ham-radio system, I need the application to automatically ensure all my transmissions comply with FCC Part 97 regulations, so I can operate legally without manually tracking compliance requirements or risking violations that could result in fines or license revocation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a station is transmitting data over amateur radio, **When** 10 minutes have elapsed since the last identification, **Then** the system automatically transmits the station callsign
2. **Given** a user attempts to transmit content, **When** the content contains prohibited material (commercial traffic, encrypted data, music), **Then** the system blocks the transmission and displays a compliance warning
3. **Given** a station is operating in beacon mode, **When** the beacon transmits, **Then** each beacon includes proper station identification
4. **Given** a transmission has occurred, **When** viewing the station log, **Then** all required information (date, time, frequency, mode, callsigns) is recorded
5. **Given** a user is operating on a specific amateur band, **When** transmitting, **Then** the system ensures bandwidth stays within legal limits for that band

### Edge Cases
- What happens when station callsign is not configured? System must prevent any transmissions
- How does system handle emergency communications? Priority override with proper emergency declaration
- What happens when operating near band edges? System must prevent out-of-band emissions
- How does system handle third-party traffic? Must ensure proper control operator procedures

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST transmit operator callsign at least once every 10 minutes during active communications (§97.119)
- **FR-002**: System MUST append callsign to the end of each transmission session (§97.119)
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent transmission of encrypted message content over amateur radio frequencies (§97.113)
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all transmissions with date, time, frequency, mode, and participating stations (§97.103)
- **FR-005**: System MUST restrict bandwidth to regulatory limits for the operating frequency band (§97.307)
- **FR-006**: System MUST block transmission of commercial traffic or business communications (§97.113)
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent transmission of music, obscene, or indecent content (§97.113)
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify beacon transmissions with callsign at regular intervals (§97.119)
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow digital signatures for authentication while keeping content unencrypted (§97.113)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide user warnings before transmitting potentially non-compliant content
- **FR-011**: System MUST support emergency communication priority with proper declaration (§97.403)
- **FR-012**: System MUST track and enforce third-party traffic restrictions when applicable (§97.115)

### Key Entities
- **Station Identity**: Operator callsign, license class, authorized privileges and bands
- **Transmission Log**: Date/time, frequency, mode, power, callsigns, message type, duration
- **Compliance Record**: Automatic ID timestamps, bandwidth measurements, content classifications
- **Band Plan**: Frequency ranges, bandwidth limits, mode restrictions per band segment
- **Content Filter**: Prohibited content patterns, commercial indicators, encryption detection
