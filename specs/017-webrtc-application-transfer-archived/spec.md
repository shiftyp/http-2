# Feature Specification: WebRTC Application Transfer

**Feature Branch**: `017-webrtc-application-transfer`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Input**: User description: "webrtc application transfer"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: WebRTC, application, transfer
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator using the HTTP-over-radio application, I want to transfer the complete application (code, assets, and data) to another station via peer-to-peer connection, so that other operators can quickly obtain and run the application without needing internet access or manual installation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two stations are connected via WebRTC, **When** the source station initiates an application transfer, **Then** the destination station receives the complete application package including all code, assets, and configuration
2. **Given** a station receives the application via transfer, **When** the transfer completes, **Then** the station can immediately run the application without additional setup
3. **Given** a transfer is in progress, **When** the connection is interrupted, **Then** the transfer can resume from the last completed checkpoint
4. **Given** multiple stations are in a mesh network, **When** one station shares the application, **Then** it propagates through the network to all reachable stations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when destination already has a different version of the application? System prompts user to choose: upgrade, downgrade, or cancel transfer
- How does system handle partial transfer failures? System retries failed chunks up to 3 times, then offers to resume or restart transfer
- What happens when insufficient storage space on destination? System calculates required space before transfer and alerts user if insufficient
- How does system handle conflicting application data/settings on destination? User data is preserved by default with option to backup or replace during transfer

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate application transfer to connected peers
- **FR-002**: System MUST package the complete application including compiled PWA assets, service worker, manifest, and optionally user-created pages
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify integrity of transferred application using SHA-256 checksum of the complete package
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to accept or reject incoming application transfers
- **FR-005**: System MUST display transfer progress including percentage complete, transfer speed, and estimated time remaining
- **FR-006**: System MUST support resumable transfers after connection interruption
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle version compatibility by comparing semantic versions and allowing user choice for upgrade/downgrade
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve user callsign, saved pages, QSO logs, and mesh routing tables during transfer unless user opts for clean install
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that destination has sufficient storage space (minimum 50MB) and required browser features (WebRTC, IndexedDB, Service Workers)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide transfer history showing last 30 days of transfers with timestamp, peer callsign, version, and status

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application Package**: Complete PWA bundle ready for transfer, includes HTML, JS, CSS, service worker, manifest.json, and icons in a compressed archive format
- **Transfer Session**: Active transfer between two stations, tracks chunk progress, peer callsigns, connection state, and resumption points
- **Transfer Manifest**: Metadata including semantic version, total size, chunk count, SHA-256 checksums, component list, and minimum browser requirements
- **Peer Connection**: WebRTC data channel between stations with automatic reconnection and bandwidth adaptation capabilities
