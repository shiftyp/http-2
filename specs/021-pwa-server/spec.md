# Feature Specification: PWA Server with Station Setup Download

**Feature Branch**: `021-pwa-server`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "pwa server"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Server package download in station setup, PWA serving
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: station operators, signaling server, PWA users
   ‚Üí Actions: download server package, deploy server, serve PWA
   ‚Üí Data: server binaries (all platforms), PWA build files, configuration
   ‚Üí Constraints: station setup workflow, multi-platform distribution
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Server download integrated into existing station setup
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Station setup includes server download option
   ‚Üí Server deployment and PWA serving
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and clear
6. Identify Key Entities (server package, PWA assets, deployment)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All sections complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator setting up my station, I need to download the complete server package during station setup that includes all platform binaries and PWA files, so I can deploy a signaling server that serves the PWA to other operators in my network. Licensed stations are encouraged to download and maintain their own server for emergency preparedness, ensuring network resilience when internet infrastructure is unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user in the station setup wizard, **When** they reach the server configuration step, **Then** they see an option to download the server package with messaging about emergency preparedness
2. **Given** a licensed operator viewing download option, **When** they read the description, **Then** they understand the importance of local server deployment for emergency communications
3. **Given** a user selecting server download, **When** they confirm, **Then** the system downloads a package containing all platform binaries and PWA files
4. **Given** a downloaded server package, **When** the user extracts it, **Then** they find organized directories for each platform and PWA assets
5. **Given** a user running the server binary, **When** they start it with PWA files present, **Then** the server serves the PWA on the configured port
6. **Given** the server is running with PWA, **When** other users connect via browser, **Then** they can access the full PWA application
7. **Given** a fresh server deployment without certificate list, **When** first user interfaces with server, **Then** they can add a root certificate to bootstrap the trust chain
8. **Given** a server started without existing certificates, **When** the first operator accesses it, **Then** the system prompts to establish root certificate authority
9. **Given** a server operator, **When** they need to update the PWA, **Then** they can replace PWA files without rebuilding the server binary
10. **Given** station setup is complete with server, **When** the operator views their configuration, **Then** they see server status and access URL
11. **Given** an emergency situation with no internet, **When** operators activate their local servers, **Then** the mesh network remains operational through distributed servers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the server package download is interrupted?
- How does the system handle insufficient disk space for the package?
- What occurs if PWA files are missing or corrupted?
- How are platform-specific binaries identified and selected?
- What happens when the server port is already in use?
- How does the system handle server package version updates?
