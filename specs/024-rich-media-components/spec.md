## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator creating pages, I want to include images, audio clips, and other rich media in my pages while respecting radio bandwidth limitations, so that I can share visual information, emergency photos, weather maps, and voice messages with other stations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the visual page builder is open, **When** user drags an IMAGE component onto the canvas, **Then** they can upload/select an image that gets optimized for radio transmission
2. **Given** an image exceeds bandwidth limits, **When** user tries to add it, **Then** system offers compression options (quality reduction, resize, format conversion)
3. **Given** a page contains audio components, **When** another station requests the page, **Then** audio files are transmitted as separate chunks with progressive loading
4. **Given** multiple media files on a page, **When** viewing bandwidth usage, **Then** user sees total size and transmission time estimates
5. **Given** a video component is added, **When** bandwidth is limited, **Then** system extracts and transmits keyframes only
6. **Given** rich media content exists, **When** station has OFDM capability, **Then** media chunks transmit in parallel for faster delivery
7. **Given** emergency priority media, **When** marked as priority, **Then** media gets transmission preference and optimal compression
8. **Given** a weather map image, **When** added to page, **Then** system recognizes and applies weather-optimized compression
9. **Given** component data needs transmission, **When** sent over radio, **Then** components are serialized as compact YAML in UTF-8 encoding
10. **Given** a page with multiple components, **When** transmitted, **Then** the YAML structure preserves hierarchy while minimizing bandwidth usage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when total media exceeds [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum page size limit - 10KB, 100KB?]?
- How does system handle unsupported media formats?
- What occurs when receiving station lacks capability to display media type?
- How are corrupted media chunks handled during transmission?
- What happens with progressive image loading over poor connections?

## Notes
This specification extends the visual page builder with rich media capabilities, enabling ham radio operators to include images, audio, and other media types in their pages. The key challenge is balancing media richness with radio bandwidth constraints, requiring intelligent compression, progressive loading, and integration with advanced transmission modes like OFDM for parallel chunk transfer.

Priority use cases include emergency communications (photos of damage, evacuation maps), weather services (radar images, forecast maps), and voice messages for situations where text is insufficient.

### Transfer Format Decision
The specification adopts YAML with UTF-8 encoding for component transfer because:
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: YAML is 25-40% more compact than JSON
- **Human Readable**: Operators can debug transmissions manually if needed
- **International Support**: UTF-8 enables multilingual emergency communications
- **Simplicity**: Plain text format works with existing radio modems
- **Hierarchical**: Preserves component relationships without complex encoding
