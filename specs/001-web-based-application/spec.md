# Feature Specification: Ham Radio Web Application for Digital Communication

**Feature Branch**: `001-web-based-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "web based application for ham radio operators that connects to various models of HF and other radios over CAT and sound interfaces, allows digitization of markdown pages and their transmission over radio, and enables mesh-like behavior forwarding pages between nodes upon request"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator, I want to connect my radio equipment to a web application so that I can digitize and transmit markdown documents over radio frequencies, and participate in a mesh network where documents can be automatically forwarded between stations upon request.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a ham radio operator has compatible radio equipment with CAT control and sound interfaces, **When** they connect their radio to the web application, **Then** the application recognizes the radio model and establishes communication with both control and audio interfaces.

2. **Given** a user has created a markdown document in the application, **When** they initiate transmission, **Then** the document is digitized and transmitted over the connected radio using appropriate encoding.

3. **Given** multiple stations are running the application and connected via radio, **When** one station requests a document from another station, **Then** the document is automatically forwarded through intermediate nodes if necessary.

4. **Given** a station receives a digitized document transmission, **When** the transmission is complete, **Then** the application decodes and displays the markdown document correctly.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when radio connection is lost during transmission?
- How does system handle simultaneous transmission requests from multiple nodes?
- What occurs when requested document doesn't exist in the mesh network?
- How does system manage corrupted or partial transmissions?
- What happens when mesh routing creates loops?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works fully offline after initial load
- **FR-002**: System MUST use service workers to cache all application resources for offline operation
- **FR-003**: System MUST use Web Serial API for direct radio CAT control from the browser
- **FR-004**: System MUST use Web Audio API for audio input/output through radio sound interfaces
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to create local "server applications" that handle HTTP requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable creation of HTML forms that submit to local server apps via radio
- **FR-007**: Local server apps MUST process form submissions and generate responses entirely client-side
- **FR-008**: System MUST store server app logic and data locally in IndexedDB
- **FR-009**: System MUST execute server app code in sandboxed JavaScript environments
- **FR-010**: System MUST transmit and receive HTTP protocol over radio frequencies using QPSK
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement mesh networking for HTTP request/response forwarding
- **FR-012**: System MUST use IndexedDB for all local storage (pages, apps, routes, data)
- **FR-013**: System MUST operate entirely offline after initial PWA installation
- **FR-014**: System MUST authenticate stations using pre-distributed signing list in IndexedDB
- **FR-015**: System MUST support single operator model with full local control
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement adaptive retry protocols based on propagation conditions
- **FR-017**: System MUST verify signing list integrity using Web Crypto API
- **FR-018**: System MUST update signing list ONLY through secure channels (NOT via radio)
- **FR-019**: The static server MUST only serve PWA files and read-only signing list
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow each station to host multiple server apps on different paths

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Radio Station**: Ham radio operator's setup with equipment, callsign, and connection status
- **Local Server App**: JavaScript application that processes HTTP requests, stored and executed locally
- **HTML Resource**: Static HTML pages with forms that submit to server apps
- **Server App Endpoint**: Path-based route handled by a local server app (e.g., /contact, /guestbook)
- **App Data Store**: IndexedDB collection for server app's persistent data
- **HTTP Request/Response**: HTTP traffic transmitted over radio between stations
- **Network Node**: Station in the mesh network with routing information
- **Signing List**: Pre-distributed database of verified station callsigns and public keys
- **Route**: Path through which HTTP traffic is forwarded in the mesh network
