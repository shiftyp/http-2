# Feature Specification: Ham Radio Web Application for Digital Communication

**Feature Branch**: `001-web-based-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "web based application for ham radio operators that connects to various models of HF and other radios over CAT and sound interfaces, allows digitization of markdown pages and their transmission over radio, and enables mesh-like behavior forwarding pages between nodes upon request"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ham radio operator, I want to connect my radio equipment to a web application so that I can digitize and transmit markdown documents over radio frequencies, and participate in a mesh network where documents can be automatically forwarded between stations upon request.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a ham radio operator has compatible radio equipment with CAT control and sound interfaces, **When** they connect their radio to the web application, **Then** the application recognizes the radio model and establishes communication with both control and audio interfaces.

2. **Given** a user has created a markdown document in the application, **When** they initiate transmission, **Then** the document is digitized and transmitted over the connected radio using appropriate encoding.

3. **Given** multiple stations are running the application and connected via radio, **When** one station requests a document from another station, **Then** the document is automatically forwarded through intermediate nodes if necessary.

4. **Given** a station receives a digitized document transmission, **When** the transmission is complete, **Then** the application decodes and displays the markdown document correctly.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when radio connection is lost during transmission?
- How does system handle simultaneous transmission requests from multiple nodes?
- What occurs when requested document doesn't exist in the mesh network?
- How does system manage corrupted or partial transmissions?
- What happens when mesh routing creates loops?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support connection to multiple radio models via CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) control interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST support audio input/output through radio sound interfaces for data transmission
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and manage markdown documents
- **FR-004**: System MUST digitize markdown documents into a format suitable for radio transmission
- **FR-005**: System MUST transmit digitized documents over connected radio equipment
- **FR-006**: System MUST receive and decode digitized transmissions from other stations
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement mesh networking behavior for document forwarding between nodes
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle document requests from other nodes in the network
- **FR-009**: System MUST forward documents through intermediate nodes when direct connection is unavailable
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain file-based storage for documents with unique identifiers composed of callsign plus file path
- **FR-011**: System MUST store document metadata in frontmatter including transmission details like hops, signal strength, and timestamps
- **FR-012**: System MUST authenticate stations using a combination of callsigns and digital certificates managed by the application's built-in certificate authority
- **FR-013**: System MUST use QPSK modulation for transmissions, compliant with FCC bandwidth regulations for HF bands
- **FR-014**: System MUST support single operator model where each operator has full control of their own station
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement adaptive retry protocols that adjust based on propagation conditions and transmission success rates
- **FR-016**: Documents MUST support user-defined retention policies configurable per document type

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Radio Station**: Represents a ham radio operator's setup including their radio equipment, callsign, and connection status
- **Markdown Document**: Text document created and managed by users, containing content to be transmitted
- **Transmission**: Represents a digitized document being sent or received over radio, including metadata like sender, recipient, and status
- **Network Node**: Represents a station in the mesh network, maintaining routing information and connectivity status
- **Document Request**: Represents a request from one node to another for a specific document
- **Route**: Represents the path through which documents are forwarded in the mesh network
