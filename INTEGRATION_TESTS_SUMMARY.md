## Test Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Component Integration
```typescript
// Example: Complete HTTP over radio flow
const response = await sendHttpOverRadio(
  sourceStation,
  destinationStation,
  httpRequest
);
```

### 2. Network Topology Simulation
```typescript
// Setting up realistic mesh network
radioChannel.setPropagation('KA1ABC', ['W2DEF', 'K4JKL']);
setupMeshTopology();
```

### 3. Channel Effects Simulation
```typescript
// Adding realistic channel noise
const noisySignal = addChannelEffects(signal, {
  snrDb: 15,
  multipath: true,
  fading: true
});
```

### 4. Adaptive Behavior Testing
```typescript
// Testing mode switching
if (errorRate > 0.1) {
  modem.setMode('BPSK'); // Switch to more robust mode
}
```

## Key Testing Insights

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all major interaction paths
